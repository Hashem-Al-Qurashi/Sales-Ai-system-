  "content": "everyone would try and do).\nAs a business owners and entrepreneurs I increasingly approach problems to find psychological solutions, rather than logical ones. Because if there were a logicalsolution, it probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem. All that's left are the psychological problems.\nExamples inspired by Rory Sutherland, CMO of Ogilvy Advertising:\n\"Any fool can sell a product by offering it for a discount, it takes great marketing to sell the same product for a premium\"\nLogical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction\nPsychologicalsolution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map\nPsychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!)\nLogical solution: make elevator faster\nPsychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator\nLogical solution: make it cheaper\nPsychological solution: make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more.\nOften, most logicalsolutions have been tried and failed. At this point in history, we must give the psychologicalsolutions a shot to solve problems.\nAs such, as business owners, it is up to us to communicate these value drivers with clarity to increase the prospect's perception of these realities. The extent to which you answer these questions in the mind of your prospect will determine the value you are creating. Only then, will we truly be able to realize the actual value of our product to the marketplace, and by extension, the egregious prices we want to charge.\nIt's difficult to separate the four value drivers from another, as most vehicles combine many of these elements together, but I will do my best to isolate and clearly explain each below.\n\n#1 Dream Outcome (Goal = Increase)\nPeople have deep, unchanging desires. This is what marriages are lost over, wars are fought over, and people will willingly die for. Our goal is not to create desire. It's simply to channel that desire through our offer and monetization vehicle.\nThe dream outcome is the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind. It's the gap between their current reality and their dreams. Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel understood, and explain how our vehicle will get them there.\nThe dream outcome is simple; it's the \"getting there\" where the value gets enhanced or detracted.\nPeople generally, and our clients specifically, want:\n. . . To be perceived as beautiful\n. . . To be respected\n. . . To be perceived as powerful\n. . . To be loved\n. . . To increase their status\nThese are all powerful drivers.\nBut multiple vehicles may accomplish the same thing. Take the desire \"to be perceived as beautiful\" for example, here are a lot of things that touch on this desire:\nMake Up\nAnti-aging creams/serums\nSupplements\nShapewear\nPlastic Surgery\nFitness\nâ†’ All these vehicles channel the desire to be perceived as beautiful.\nAnd if we further unpack the idea of a desire to be beautiful, we see that it may be a surface-level declaration of a deeper desire to achieve higher status in one's social group.\nThe dream outcome value driver is most prominently used when comparing the relative value between two different desires being satisfied. In general, the dream outcome that most directly increases a prospect's status will be the one they value most. As such, a prospect may value that entire category of vehicles that satisfy one desire more than another category that satisfies a different desire. For many men, making money is more important than being handsome. Why? Because money drives status for men more than being handsome does. So, in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than offers that help them look good.\nI once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept. He explained how his wife, Collette, at first hearing about this status concept, rejected it. She claimed she wasn't driven by status and would never want to drive a Lamborghini. Instead, she favored her minivan. But, after talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status amongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show she was a good mother (increase in status). So it's not about the money, it's about the status (the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or professionally). Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects drooling.\nPro Tip: Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others\nWhen writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect's achievement. Connect the dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards. Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40 yards past theirs . . . they'll ask you what's changed . . . only you will know.\nThat being said, when comparing two products or services that satisfy the same desire, the value from the dream outcomes will cancel out (since they are the same). It will be the other three variables that drive the difference in perceived value, and ultimately price. For example, if we have two products or services that both help make someone beautiful, it will be the likelihood of achievement, time delay, and effort required that will differentiate the perceived value of each offer.\nSimply put: if two things make someone beautiful, what makes one worth $50,000 and another $5? Answer: The extent of the other three value variables.\n\n#2 Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal = Increase)\nThis was the last of the variables I added when trying to think through this framework a few years ago. I just felt like something was missing with only the other three.\nThen I realized people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this \"the perceived likelihood of achievement.\" In other words, \"How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?\"\nFor example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon's 10,000th patient versus their first?\nIf you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient ever.\nSo you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want.\nBoth surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery (if anything, the guy who has done it 10,000 times would likely get it done faster and still charge more). The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which incentivizes their desirability.\nPeople value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect's conviction that your offer will \"actually\" work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees (more on these later).\n\n#3 Time Delay (Goal = Decrease)\nTime delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when they purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is.\nThere are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are short-term experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen \"along the way\" and provide value.\nIt's good to understand both. The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their \"dream outcome.\" But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer. We want clients to have a big emotional win early (as close as possible to their purchase). This gives them the emotional buy in and the momentum to \"see it through\" to their ultimate goal.\nFor example, it takes a while to add an extra $239,000 per year to a gym. But that's what they're buying. So, once they have purchased, we need to create emotional wins fast. One way we do this is to get their ads live and get them to close their first $2,000 sale within their first seven days. By doing this, their decision to work with us is reinforced, and they immediately trust us more. This makes them more likely to follow the rest of our systems and get to their ultimate destination.\nPro Tip: Fast Wins\nAlways try and incorporate short-term, immediate wins for a client. Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made the right decision trusting you and your business.\nLet me give you another example. If I sell someone a bikini body, their time delay to realize that outcome may be 12 months or even longer. Along the way, though, as they change their bodies, they may experience higher sex drive, more energy, and an increased community of friends.\nThey aren't initially buying those things, but those things may become short-term benefits that keep them in the game long enough to achieve their ultimate outcome. They buy the dream, but they stay for the benefits they discover along the way. The faster and more clearly you can demonstrate those benefits, the more valuable your service will be. For a weight loss customer, we would get them to meet someone else so they immediately had some social benefits from the program, and we usually gave them a more aggressive diet in the beginning. Why? Because we wanted them to have a big, fast emotional win, so we could get them to commit to the long term. This is also backed by science. People who experience a victory early on are more likely to continue with something than those who do not.\nThat being said, having to wait 12 to 24 months to get what you want is a long time when you can do liposuction and be done in an afternoon. This shows just one of the reasons people pay $25,000 for liposuction with a tummy tuck, while people will barely pay $100/mo to join a bootcamp.\nBut that's not the only reason, is it?\nThat leads me to the last driver of value - effort and sacrifice.\nPro Tip: Fast Beats Free\nThe only thing that beats \"free\" is \"fast.\" People will pay for speed. Many companies have entered free spaces and done exceedingly well with a \"speed first\" strategy. A few notable examples: The MVD vs DMV wait in line forever or pay $50 you can skip the line and get your license renewed privately. Fedex vs USPS (when it absolutely positively has to be there overnight). Spotify vs Slow Free Music. Uber vs Walking. Fast beats free. Many will always be willing to pay (price) for the (value) of speed. So if you find yourself in a market competing against free, double down on speed.\n\n#4 Effort & Sacrifice (Goal = Decrease)\nThis is what it \"costs\" people in ancillary costs, aka \"other costs accrued along the way.\" These can be both tangible and intangible.\nUsing the fitness versus liposuction example, let's look at the difference in effort and sacrifice:\nMassive difference, right?\nIn fact, in looking at the marketing of plastic surgeons, these are the exact pain points they hit on when they say things like: \"Tired of wasting countless hours in the gym. . . . tired of trying diets that just don't work?\"\nThis is why when you sell fitness, you have to spend an hour arm-wrestling a client to give over 1/10th to 1/100th of the amount of money they pay for surgery. There's just not a lot of perceived value because the perceived likelihood of achievement, the time delay to achievement, and the effort and sacrifice are so high.\nSo even though the outcome is the same, the value of the vehicles are dramatically different, hence the difference in price.\nDecreasing the effort and sacrifice, or at least the perceived effort and sacrifice, can massively boost the appeal of your offer.\nIn an ideal world, a prospect would want to simply \"say yes\" and have their dream outcome happen with no more effort on their behalf.\nThis is why \"done for you services\" are almost always more expensive than \"do-it-yourself\" because the person doesn't have all the effort and sacrifice. There is also a component of \"perceived likelihood of achievement\" difference as well. People believe that if an expert does it, then they will be more likely to achieve the outcome than if they try on their own.\nMy hope is that you now have a foundational understanding of the components of value and how the interplay between each of the components creates or detracts from the value someone might be willing to pay.",
