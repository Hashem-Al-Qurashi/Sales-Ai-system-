When Alex talks about acquisition, you should listen (as long as you don't hate money).\"\nBROOKE CASTILLO, CEO, LIFE COACH SCHOOL\n\n\"My career can be broken into two chapters: the first was 15 years of banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why I was not fulfilling my potential. The second chapter started when I read '$100M Offers' by Alex hormozi. It was then that I had the confidence to know exactly how to have the success that I knew I was capable of enjoying. If you are a business owner that is done settling for less than your potential, this book will quickly show you that it's not your fault; no one has taught you how to make irresistible offers. This book will change that within a few chapters. Consider this book your second chapter. It is an absolute game changer.\"\nRYAN DANIEL MORAN FOUNDER, CAPITALISM.COM\n\n\"We first found out about Alex and instantly bought his book. It's the best book I've ever read really in business. Probably the biggest thing I learned from him is that so many times in business you want to charge your customers more and you almost feel guilty like 'oh my gosh can I really do this?' but I think there's nobody better that really puts packages and prices together that not only you can increase your price for your business but you're also increasing the value for the customer at the exact same time. Since we started working with him...within two months...our business was already doing $10M/yr in sales...INSTANT DOUBLE and it's only been two months since we came in touch with him and our business is on a run rate to do $23M/yr in sales now. Just from changing our pricing, our packaging, and at the same time delivering better results and outcomes for the clients that we work with.\"\nANDREW ARGUE FOUNDER, CEO ACCOUNTINGTAX.COM\n\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES\nThere are no rules.\n\nTo Leila:\nYou are my ride-or-die:\na term used to describe a person (usually a woman) that is willing to do anything for their partner, friend, or family, even in the face of danger.\nCouldn't do this without you . . . and wouldn't want to.\nYou make waking up everyday worth it.\nThank you for being unapologetically you.\nYou're a down motherfucker.\nTo Trevor:\nYou're the best friend a guy could ask for.\nThank you for spending hours upon hours beating up the ideas that became this book with me.\nIt would not be half as good as it is without your relentless drive for simplification and clarity.\nEternally grateful for our friendship.\nYou make me feel less alone in the world.\nCheers to becoming old and crotchety.",

Given a 10 percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you're still going to be wrong nine times out of ten . . . We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.\"\nJEFF BEZOS\n\nAs entrepreneurs, we make bets everyday. We are gamblers ― gambling our hard-earned money on labor, inventory, rent, marketing, etc., all with the hopes of a higher pay out. Oftentimes, we lose. But, sometimes, we win and win BIG.\nHowever, there is a difference between gambling in business and gambling in a casino. In a casino, the odds are stacked against you. With skill, you can improve them, but never beat them. In contrast, in business, you can improve your skills to shift the odds in your favor. Simply stated, with enough skill, you can become the house.\nAfter beginning a series of books on acquisition, it became apparent that I could not talk about any other topic without first addressing the offer: the starting point of any conversation to initiate a transaction with a customer. What you are literally providing them in exchange for their money. That's where it all begins.\nThis book is about how to make profitable offers. Specifically, how to reliably turn advertising dollars into (enormous) profits using a combination of pricing, value, guarantees, and naming strategies. I call the proper combination of these components: a Grand Slam Offer.\nI chose this term partially in homage to the above quote from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and because, like a grand slam in baseball, a Grand Slam Offer is both very good and very rare. Additionally, to extend the baseball metaphor, it takes no more effort to make a Grand Slam Offer than to strike out. The difference is dictated by the skill of the marketer and how well he connects his offer with his audience's desires. In business you can have so-so offers: the \"singles\" and \"doubles' that keep the game going, pay the bills, and keep the lights on. But, unlike baseball, where a grand slam scores a maximum of four runs, a Grand Slam Offer in the business world, can score you a thousand-fold pay off and result in a world where you never need to work again. It would be like connecting with the ball so well during one single at bat that you automatically win every World Series for the next hundred years.\nIt takes years of practice to make something as complicated as hitting a major league fastball into the bleachers look effortless. Your stance, vision, prediction, ball speed, bat speed, and hip placement all must be perfect. In marketing and customer acquisition (the process of getting new clients), there are just as many variables that must all align to truly \"knock it out of the park.\" But with enough practice and enough skill, you can turn the wild world of acquisition, which will throw curveballs at you everyday, into a homerun derby, knocking offer after offer out of the stadium. To everyone else, your success will look unbelievable. But to you, it will feel like \"just another day at work.\" The greatest hitters of all time also have many strike outs, just as there are many failed offers in the track record of great marketers. We learn skills through failure and practice. We do this knowing that nine out of ten times we will be wrong. We still act boldly, hoping for that offer we connect with so well that it results in our big payoff.\nThe good news is that in business, you only need to hit one Grand Slam Offer to retire forever. I have done this four or five times in my life. As for my track record, I have a 36:1 lifetime return on my advertising dollars over my business career. Consider this my lifetime \"batting average,\" if you will. That means for every $1 I spend on advertising I get $36 back, a 3600% return. That is my average over eight years. And I continue to improve.\nThis book is my attempt to share that skill with you, with a specific focus on building Grand Slam Offers, so you can experience the same levels of success. It's also the first in a series of books meant to get entrepreneurs to financial freedom, in plain words, \"fuck you\" money. Subsequent books in this series will look more deeply at getting more customers, converting more prospects into clients, making those clients worth more, and other lessons I wish I had learned earlier scaling my businesses.\n\nPro Tip: Faster, Deeper Learning By Reading & Listening At Same Time\nHere's a life hack I discovered a long time ago….If you listen to the audiobook while reading the ebook or physical book you will increase your reading speed and retain more information. The contents are being stored in more places in your brain. This is how I read most things worth reading. I've priced my products as cheap as the platforms will allow me to, so this isn't a ploy to make an extra .99 cents - promise. If you want to give it a try, go ahead and grab the audio version and see for yourself. You might find it as valuable as I have (as someone who struggles to stay focused). I took two days to talk this book out loud and record it. I figured I'd put this \"hack\" at the beginning of the book so you had a chance to do it if you found this first chapter valuable enough to earn your attention.",
