I learned the hard\nway, and my businesses suffered for a long time because of it.\nLet me explain. The market is continuously growing. The stock market grows at 9 percent per year. If we aren't growing at\n9 percent per year, we are falling behind. “Maintenance,” in the most generic sense, would be 9 percent growth year over year.\nFurthermore, if you’re in a growing marketplace, then you might have to grow at 20-30 percent per year, just to keep up, or\nrisk falling behind. So you can see how maintenance is a myth.\nSo, then,what does it take to grow? Thankfully, just three simple things:\n1. Get more customers\n2. Increase their average purchase value\n3. Get them to buy more times\nThat’s it.\nSure, there are lots of ways to acquire customers and zillions of ways to increase order value and purchase frequency, but,\nsimply put, that’s it. Those are the only three ways to grow.\nExample: If I sell 10 clients a month, and a client is worth $1,000 to me over their lifetime (through avg cart value x avg\nnumber of purchases), then my business will cap at $10,000/mo (10 x $1,000).\n10 New Clients/mo x $1000 Lifetime Value = $10,000/mo max revenue.\nIf you want to grow, you’ve got to either sell more clients every month (while maintaining suitable margins) or have them\nbe worth more (by increasing the profit per purchase or number of times they buy).

When I stood in that Las Vegas penthouse in my “beast mode” t-shirt I was clueless\nabout such terms. Let me help you be better than, well, me.\nGross Profit: The revenue minus the direct cost of servicing an ADDITIONAL customer. If I sell lotion for $10 and it\ncosts me $2, my gross profit is $8 or 80 percent. If I sell agency services for $1,000/mo and it costs me $100/mo in labor to\nrun that client's advertising, then my gross profit is $900 or 90 percent. Note: This is not net profit. Net profit is what’s left\nover after all expenses are paid, not just the direct costs of fulfillment.\nLifetime Value: The gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer. This is gross profit multiplied by the\nnumber of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime. Using the example above, if the average customer\nstays five months, and they pay $1,000/mo while it costs me $100 per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is $4,500.\nHere’s the breakdown:\nRevenue: ($1,000/mo * 90% Gross Margin * 5 months) = $4,500 Lifetime Value (LTV)\nNote that the indirect costs, like admin, software, rent, etc., are not included in LTV.\nNote: You will find different definitions for lifetime value depending on the source. The biggest difference is that some\nsources only count total revenue, while others focus on gross profit over the lifespan. I focus on gross profit. Y",

I’ve spent (and continue to spend) hundreds of\nhours on calls and in-person meetings consulting entrepreneurs on crafting their offers. I have seen the ones that take off into the\nstratosphere and those that fizzle.\nHaving a Grand Slam offer makes it almost impossible to lose. But why? What gives it such an impact? In short, having a\nGrand Slam Offer helps with all three of the requirements for growth: getting more customers, getting them to pay more, and\ngetting them to do so more times.\nHow? It allows you to differentiate yourself from the marketplace. In other words, it allows you to sell your product based\non VALUE not on PRICE.\nCommoditized = Price Driven Purchases (race to the bottom)\nDifferentiated = Value Driven Purchases (sell in a category of one with no comparison. Yes, market matters, which I will\nexpound on in the next chapter)\nA commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it’s prone to purchases based on\n“price” instead of “value.” If all products are “equal,” then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. In other words, if\na prospect compares your product to another and thinks “these are pretty much the same, I’ll buy the cheaper one,” then they\ncommoditized you. How embarrassing! But really . . . it’s one of the worst experiences a value-driven entrepreneur can have.\nT",

So you can sell at whatever price you\nget the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else. As a result, it gets you more customers, at higher ticket prices,\nfor less money. If you like fancy marketing terms, it breaks down like this:\n1. Increased Response Rates (think clicks)\n2. Increased Conversion (think sales)\n3. Premium Prices (think charging a lot of money).\nHaving a Grand Slam Offer increases your response rates to advertisements (aka more people will click or take an action\non an advertisement they see containing a Grand Slam Offer).\nIf you pay the same amount for eyeballs but 1) more people respond, 2) more of those responses buy, and 3) they buy for\nhigher prices, your business grows.\nI’ve “struck gold” on my share of offers.

This gets you out\nof the pricing war and into a category of one. The next chapter will focus on finding the correct market to apply our pricing\nstrategies to. It’s one of the most important things to get right. A grand slam offer given to the wrong audience will fall on deaf\n\n\fears. We want to avoid that at all costs.

Low prices! ….Best taste!”\nThe students kept going until eventually they had run out of answers. They looked at each other waiting for the professor to\nspeak. The room finally fell quiet.\nThe professor smiled and replied, “A starving crowd.”\nYou could have the worst hot dogs, terrible prices, and be in a terrible location, but if you’re the only hot dog stand in town\nand the local college football game breaks out, you’re going to sell out. That’s the value of a starving crowd.\nAt the end of the day, if there is a ton of demand for a solution, you can be mediocre at business, have a terrible offer, and\nhave no ability to persuade people, and you can still make money.\nAn example of this was the toilet paper shortage at the beginning of Covid-19. There was no offer. The pricing was\natrocious. And there was no compelling sales pitch. But because the crowd was so big and so starving, rolls of toilet paper\nwere going for $100 or more. That’s the value of a starving crowd.\nSelling Newspapers\nA good friend of mine, Lloyd, owned a software business that served newspapers for almost a decade. They set up digital\nad services on newspaper websites with a few clicks and instantly helped them sell a whole new ad product. He only charged\nthem a percentage of the revenue he added. So if they made nothing, neither did he. It was pure gain for the papers and a great\noffer.\nB",

This entire book sits atop the\nassumption that you have at least a “normal” market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the\nmarketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or\nimproved relationships.

They’re in massive pain. There are\nplenty of them, and it's constantly adding new people. This is a great market!”\nHe just forgot a crucial point: your audience needs to be able to afford the service you’re charging them for. Make sure\nyour targets have the money, or access to the amount of money, needed to buy your services at the prices you require to make it\nworth your time.\n3) Easy to Target\nLet’s say you have a perfect market, but no way of finding the people who comprise it. Well, making a Grand Slam Offer\nwill be difficult. I make my life easier by looking for easy-to-target markets. Examples of this are avatars that have\nassociations they belong to, mailing lists, social media groups, channels they all watch, etc. If our potential customers are all\ngathered together somewhere, then we can market to them. If searching them out, however, is like finding needles in a haystack,\nthen it can be very difficult to get your offer in front of any potentially interested eyes.\nThis point is tactical. It is reality, not theoretical. For instance, you may want to serve rich doctors.

Declining markers are like headwinds.\nThey make all efforts harder. This was Lloyd's example. Newspapers had three of the four makings of a great market: (1) lots\nof pain, (2) purchasing power, (3) easy to target. But they were shrinking (fast). No matter how hard he tried, the entire\nmarketplace was fighting against him. Business is hard enough, and markets move quickly.

Why? Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more\npain as they are nearer their deaths (pain), have more buying power (money), and are easy to find (targeting). Lastly, at the time\nof this writing, there are more people turning 65 each year than turning 20 (growing).\nThat is the idea.

Then think about who\nmight value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what you want (money), and can be found\neasily (targeting).

So for 99.6 percent of readers below $10M per year, it’s almost\nalways easier to serve fewer clients more narrowly. But if you want to go beyond that, you may (depending on the size of your TAM) have to broaden\nyour audience by going up market, down market, or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.\nFor context, many companies expanded to $30M+ per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If\nyou are at $1M or $3M, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong.

We could tie their increase to even one more\nsale or one more deal and it would be worth more. But there are a lot of sales people. So this might be a $99 product. Neat, but\nwe can do better.\nSo let’s go down another level of niching and call our product…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps.”\nFollowing the same principles of specificity, now we know our sales people probably have very experienced deals and\ncommissions. A single sale would easily net this salesman $500 (or more), so it would be easy to justify a $499 price tag. This\nis already a 25x increase in price for almost an identical product.

Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.\nIf you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It\ntakes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It\nmeans your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You’ll never become world class if you\nstop after a failed attempt.\nIf you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll\nlikely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set — the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into\naccount pain, money, targeting, and growth — in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes\ntwice.\nHaving established how to nail a market, let’s get back to pricing. The first step to making crazy money is charging\npremium prices.\n\nFREE GIFT #2 BONUS TUTORIAL: WINNING MARKETS\nIf you want to know more about how I pick markets, and find niches that are profitable, go to Acquisition.com/training/offers course then watch\n“Winning Markets” for a short video tutorial.

          "text": "igher Price Means Higher Value (Literally)\nIn a blind taste test, researchers asked consumers to rate three wines: a low-priced wine, a medium-priced wine and an\nexpensive wine. Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible. They rated them, unsurprisingly,\nin order of their price, with the most expensive being the “best,” the second most expensive being “second best,” and the third,\ncheapest option, being rated as “cheap wine.”\nWhat the tasters didn’t know is that the researchers gave them the exact same wine all three times. Yet, the tasters reported\na wide discrepancy between the “high priced” wine and the “cheap” wine. This has deep implications for the direct\nrelationship between value and price.\nIn essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more\nallure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be\nslightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, “This is so much more\nexpensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.”\nThat is how you create a category of one. In this new perceived marketplace, you are a monopoly and can make monopoly\nprofits. That is the point.\nOne final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the\nresult, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested.

Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as\nhumanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That\nsting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most\nattention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than\nyour competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else. This is how you win.\nBut I know this isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. Your product must deliver. So many wish to shortcut the real work. Do that\nand you will fail.

That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can\ncharge these rates and get people to say yes.\nFrom this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about “what's fair.” Every enormous company in the world\ncharges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except\nthey don’t mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they\ndon’t mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king’s ransom for your eyeballs,\nand it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You need to have a big discrepancy between\nwhat something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.\nMany entrepreneurs believe that charging “too much” is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than\nyour product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a\nhundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the\nprospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.\nFor example, one of my private clients (whose company I have equity in) is in the photography space. O",

Because if there were\na logical solution, it probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem. All that’s left are the psychological problems.\nExamples inspired by Rory Sutherland, CMO of Ogilvy Advertising:\n“Any fool can sell a product by offering it for a discount, it takes great marketing to sell the same product for a premium”\nLogical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction\nPsychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map\nPsychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!)\nLogical solution: make elevator faster\nPsychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator\nLogical solution: make it cheaper\nPsychological solution: make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more.\nOften, most logical solutions have been tried and failed. At this point in history, we must give the psychological solutions a shot to solve problems.",

As such, a prospect may value that entire category of vehicles that satisfy one desire more than another category\nthat satisfies a different desire.

So, in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than\noffers that help them look good.\nI once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept. He explained how his wife, Collette, at first hearing about this\nstatus concept, rejected it. She claimed she wasn’t driven by status and would never want to drive a Lamborghini. Instead, she\nfavored her minivan. But, after talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status\namongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show she was a good mother (increase in status).

The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which\nincentivizes their desirability.\nPeople value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect’s conviction that your offer will “actually”\nwork for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to\nincrease value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what\nwe choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees (more on these later).\n#3 Time Delay (Goal = Decrease)\nTime delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when\nthey purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is.\nThere are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are shortterm experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen “along the way” and provide value.\nIt’s good to understand both. The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that\nmakes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience.

So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.\nConvergent & Divergent Thinking\nIn simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and\nconverge on a singular answer. Think math.\nExample:\nYou have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.\nIt takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).\nYou need to get to 110 sales . . .\nHow many sales people must you hire?\nDeduced Information:\n1 salesperson = 100 calls\n4 calls = 1 close\n100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls\n25 closes per rep\nGoal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4\nSince you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.\nANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.\nMath problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to\nthink this way. That is because it’s easy to grade.\nBut life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a\nsingle problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking,\nyou can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others. Cool right?\nHere’s what life presents us for divergent thinking: Multiple Variables, Known & Unknown, Dynamic Conditions, Multiple\nAnswers.\nA",

Without a\nvaluable product or service, the rest of the book won’t be as actionable. We just covered all the problems we are going to\nsolve. The second half of making your offer is breaking down tactically what we are going to do/provide for our client. In\ntheory, we’d all love to fly out and live with our customers to fix their problems. In reality, that wouldn’t make a very scalable\nbusiness. We need our offer to be incredibly attractive and profitable.\nThat being said, if this is your first Grand Slam Offer, it’s important to over-deliver like crazy. Maybe flying out isn’t such\na bad idea in the beginning. Make some sales, then think about how to make it easier for your clients. You want them to think to\nthemselves, “I get all this, for only that?” In essence, you want them to perceive tremendous value.\nEveryone buys bargains. Some people just buy $100,000 things for only $10,000. That’s where we want to live: high\nprices, but a steal for the value (like hopefully this book so far).\nSales to Fulfillment Continuum",

If you lower\nwhat you have to do, it increases how hard your product or service is to sell. If you do as much as possible, it makes your\nproduct or service easy to sell but hard to fulfill because there’s more demand on your time investment. The trick, and the\nultimate goal, is to find a sweet spot where you sell something very well that’s also easy to fulfill.\nI have always lived by the mantra, “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction.” This means I generate demand first.\nThen, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my\nmarketing, or decide to offer less for the same price.\nPracticality drives this practice. If you can’t get demand flowing in, then you have no idea whether what you have is good.\nI’d rather do more for every customer and have cash flow coming in, then optimize my business but have zero cash flow\ncoming in after (and zero idea about what I need to adjust to better serve my customers).",

But I wanted to make sure they got way more than they paid me. So here’s\nwhat I ended up doing to fill their gyms: I would fly out to their gym for 21 days, spend my own money on hotels, car rentals,\neating out, advertising, generate the leads, work the leads, then sell for them. I would even do the first onboarding meeting with\nclients to get them started. In short, I did everything. I took on all the risk.\nThey only had to put down $500 to “reserve” their date, which I made refundable at the end of their launch. So they had 0\nfinancial risk, 0 time risk, 0 effort, and the deal was, I got to keep all the up front cash collected from selling their services, and\nthey got clients for free. You can imagine how this was a pretty compelling offer.\nOn my own, I was able to sell about $100,000/mo in up front cash for myself. So these deals were very lucrative for me.\nOver time, I scaled that to a team of 8 guys selling every month. But this began to wear on me and the team. It was at that point\nthat I realized that if I were to simply teach them how to do what I did, I could charge maybe a third of what I would normally\nmake, but I would be able to help hundreds of gyms a month instead of eight. And, I could do it all sleeping in my own bed\nevery night.\nMy promise was fundamentally the same: I will fill your gym in 30 days. It was simply the how and what I did that\nchanged. T",

As a result, I lost many sales.\nOne month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got\ninto the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn’t work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this\nsale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded “I’ll\nmake you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal.

Cause them to believe they will be likely to succeed\n3. Make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and sacrifice\n4. Help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want with far less time investment.\nWhat should remain are offer items that are 1) low cost, high value and 2) high cost, high value.\nExample: Let’s say I moved in with someone and did their shopping, exercising, and cooking for them. They would\nprobably believe they would definitely lose weight.

Instead, I’ve found demand to be fractal (80/20). In other words, one fifth of the prospects are willing to pay five\ntimes the price (or more).\nIn the example, I might have ten people willing to pay $500, but two of them willing to pay $5000. So, I would make more,\nhave lower costs (more profits), provide more value, and increase the demand in the remaining prospect base by selling fewer\nunits. Think about how exclusive scenario one vs scenario two would feel. Think about all the people who would want to\npurchase, but would not be able to. Would this increase or decrease their desire? It would increase it, of course.\nOn top of that, if people see that others who ‘were able to get in’ are loving it, it would further increase their desire. And\nthe next time, they would act with more urgency, and be willing to pay more for the same thing than they originally did. So now,\nin the aftermath of our second scenario, we still have eight people who have unsatisfied desire. This increases their desire\nfurther.

All desire has been satisfied. When you “pull the trigger too early,”\neach successive instance we promote, we sell even fewer. Eventually, we run out of sufficient demand to make even a single\nsale. This is the sad state many businesses find themselves in always trying to generate more demand to make another quick\nsale.\nHormozi Law: The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. “The longer the runway, the bigger the plane\nthat can take off.”\nWe must endeavor to keep our supply (and satisfaction of desire) under the demand that we are able to generate. This\nmaximizes profits and keeps desire ravenous in our customer base. This is the real key to never going hungry.\nSummary Points\nThe reason I titled this sub-section “Delicate Dance of Desire” is that supply and demand are inversely correlated (in\ntheory). If you satisfy zero desire (provide zero supply), you will not make money, and eventually leave people feeling\nrejected (Note: it takes much longer than you think).\nConversely, if you satisfy all the demand, you will kill your golden goose, and not know where your next meal will come\nfrom. Mastering supply and demand comes from the elegant dance between the two. If you sleep with your significant other\neveryday they have less desire than if you haven’t slept with them for a week.

So the next time you make the offer they will be far more likely to take you up on it.\nFun fact: Chanel, a brand that has maintained insane margins and pricing for over a century, is a master of scarcity. They\nsend only 1-2 of each piece to each store so every store has a different selection and every item is the last or second to last\nitem in stock. This allows them to price far above market and turn buying impulses into purchases.\nServices\nWith services, especially if you want to consistently get customers, it can be a little trickier to use scarcity. But I will show\nyou a few simple ways to employ scarcity ethically to increase your take rates on offers. These all have similar elements with\nvery slight tweaks. I'm enumerating these because one of these might mentally fit your business model more than others.\n1. Total Business Cap - Only accepting….X Clients. Only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going). This\nputs a cap on how many clients you service but also keeps them in it. You create a waiting list for new prospects. The moment\nthe door opens, they jump right in and price resistance disappears. Periodically, you can increase capacity by 10-20% then cap\nit again. This works well for your highest tiers or service levels.\na) This is like saying “My agency only will service twenty-five customers total. P",

          "text": "eriod.” Over time you can increase\nyour prices and squeeze the lower performing accounts out and bring in new more profitable accounts, or, you can\nperiodically ‘open slots’ as your capacity allows (always leaving some demand unmet).\n2. Growth Rate Cap - Only accepting X clients per week (on-going) “We only accept 5 new clients per week and we\nalready have the first 3 spots taken. I have 6 more calls this week, so you can take the spot or one of my next calls and you can\nwait until we reopen.” I have used this method since the beginning of my business. I always knew what my capacity was per\nweek, and simply chose to let our prospects know how many openings we had left. This banks on the fact that you can only\nhandle a certain amount of new clients anyways, on a regular basis, so you might as well let them know it.\n3. Cohort Cap - Only accepting….X clients per class or cohort. Similar to the above, except done on whatever cadence\nyou desire. Only accepting X amount per class or cohort over a given period is another way of thinking about it. Imagine you\nonly start clients monthly or quarterly. This helps you get some cadences in place in your business operationally while also\nallowing your sales team some legitimate scarcity. Example: “We take on 100 clients 4 times a year.

Then, tell people. You will make more money than you thought possible. These also tend to be some of the best clients. And limit your\ndelivery to something that you don’t hate. For me, I hate emails and messages but dont mind zoom calls. Make it work for your working style. The cream of\nthe crop (the 1% of 1% will adjust and take action).\n\nPro Tip - Once You’re Out, You Can Never Come Back\nYou can create scarcity by also capping your service level and saying that if they leave than can never return.

It’s small things like this that nudge\npeople to take the action they know they should take anyways.\nObviously the less frequently you kick off new customers, the more powerful this is.

          "text": "2) Rolling Seasonal Urgency\nIn a digital setting, having actual sign up date countdowns is very useful. But make sure they are real. If they aren’t, you’ll\nlose credibility and just look like every other wannabe marketer. This is very common with internet businesses that use\n“launch” models. I personally love having the dates that I am running a promotion through on my landing pages and in my copy.\nI want it to be visible everywhere. The nice thing is that you can always fire up another ad campaign and a new landing page\nwith new dates and be right as rain. You will see your conversions go through the roof, and it takes maybe five minutes of\nediting — well worth the time investment.\nExample: Our New Year Promotion ends Jan 30!\nNext Month: Our Valentines Lovers Promo Ends Feb 30!\nNext Month: Our Sexy By Spring Special Ends March 31!\nNext Month: Our Fools in Love April Promo Ends April 30!\nThe actual promotion may be the same, but naming it something different “by season” gives you a “real” differentiator that\ngives you a start and a finish. Deadlines drive decisions. By simply having these, you can point to them and let human beings\npush themselves over the edge so as not to miss out.\n\nPro Tip - Local Businesses: This is my number one strategy for local businesses. They must vary their marketing more frequently than national\nadvertisers. Putting a new wrapper with a date on the same core service gives you urgency and novelty that will consistently outperform the “same old”\ncampaigns.",

          "text": "3) Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency\nThis is another way of creating urgency using your actual offer or promotion/pricing structure as the thing they could miss\nout on (kind of brilliant!). It allows businesses that sell clients year round to still use urgency. For example, “Yes, let’s get you\nstarted today so you can take advantage of the discount you came in for. I’m not sure how long we will be running it as we\nchange them every 4 weeks or so, and this is one of the better ones we have run in a while.”\nThis creates some fear of missing out on the promotion (or discount or bonuses), rather than your actual service. It would\nbe a lie to say that if you own a roofing business you won’t service them if they buy after the date. But, if you talk specifically\nabout the promotion you can often elicit the same urgency on buying in the prospect while maintaining your integrity — winwin. You can interchange a pricing promotion, discount, or added bonuses like free install or free onboarding or an extra\nworkshop (valued at $1,000) if they buy now. These are all things you can swap around your core offer to create urgency.\n\nPro Tip - Clean Your Pipeline With Every Price Change: If you ever really are planning on raising your prices (hopefully soon if you are reading this\nbook!) then you can always clean out your pipeline by letting people know “The price is going up! So get in now!” Never raise your prices without letting\npeople know. It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from the people in the pipeline who were on the fence.",

The opportunity itself has a ticking time clock,\nas all great opportunities do. Every second someone delays, they miss out on disproportionate gains.\nExample: If I was explaining an arbitrage opportunity between buying products on ebay and selling them on amazon, this\nmarket inefficiency would over time correct itself. The sooner someone acts the better it will be for them. This could be true\nfor selling someone on the opportunity of trading crypto currencies, buying a stock, getting into a new platform to advertise\nbefore competitors jump on the bandwagon. Highly competitive job environments often get job offers that are “exploding\noffers” everyday they wait to take the job, their pay or bonuses decrease. This forces prospects to make fast decisions rather\nthan try and “wait it out” to see if they get a better offer.\nAll of these examples show opportunities that decay with time, so if you find yourself in front of an opportunity like this,\nmake sure to emphasize it!\nSummary Points\nAdding a deadline and incorporating one or multiple forms of urgency will get more people to take action than would\notherwise.

In this chapter, I’m going to cover: what to offer, how to pick them, how to value them, how to\npresent them, how to price them.\nThe main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its\ncomponent parts and stacked as bonuses (see image). The entirety of our offer we came up with at the end of the last section.\nThis section is about how to present those pieces in what order. For example, I may in fact do lots of things in my service, but\nuntil I enumerate them, they are unknown. This is why every infomercial of all time continues on with “but wait….there’s\nmore!”\nThey would not use these techniques unless they were effective, as every second of air time costs money and must be\njustified with ROI. You’ll also notice that if you watch those old infomercials, they would sell one knife for $38.95 then\ninclude 37 other knives, sharpeners, pans, and guarantees to beat the prospect into submission. They establish the price, then\nthey expand upon it until you feel it’s such a good deal it would be stupid to pass it up.\nThe reason this works is we are increasing the prospect’s price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered\ninstead of cutting the price.

It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding\nbonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.\n\nPresenting Bonuses 1-on-1 vs Group Selling\nThere are key differences between pitching to a group versus a single person. Group selling is beyond the scope of this\nbook. But I want to at least address when a bonus would be brought up in a 1-1 selling scenario. When selling one on one, you\nask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses. If they say yes, then after they have signed up, you let them know the\nadditional bonuses they're going to get.

We’re going to provide all these bonuses to them anyways, but it increases the perception of our offer’s value by\nlayering these bonuses one at a time.\nBonus Bullets\nThat being said, there are a few key things to remember when offering bonuses:\n1.

The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it\ncontinues to expand the price to value discrepancy.

Create checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, and anything else that would take lots of time and effort to\ncreate on one’s own, but is easy to use once created. Anything that you can invest in one time that clearly cost time\nor money to create, but can be given away endless time is a perfect fit for a bonus.\n2. Beyond that, make a habit to record every workshop, every webinar, every event, every interview and use them as\nadditional bonuses (as needed to crush a perceived obstacle).\n3. Proactively negotiate group discounts and a referral commission with adjacent businesses that solve needs your\ncustomer will have as a result of beginning this process with you. What’s the next natural thing they might want? Go\nto those businesses, get a deal for them they could never get for themselves (because you are negotiating with the\npurchasing power of all your customers at once, very powerful).",

That being said, how much more attractive\ncan a guarantee make an offer?\nJason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer 2-4x simply by changing\nthe quality of the guarantee. It’s that important.\nFrom an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees:\n1. Unconditional\n2. Conditional\n3. Anti-Guarantee\n4. Implied Guarantees.\nYou must always hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why.\nBut won’t people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?\nSometimes, but not usually. That being said, you must understand the math. If you close 130 percent as many people, and\nyour refund percentage doubles from 5 percent to 10 percent, you’ve still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that\nall goes to the bottom line.\nEx: 100 sales, 5 refunds (5%) = 95 Net Sales\nGuarantee Offer 130 sales, 13 refunds (10%)= 117 Net sales\n117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)\nDon't be emotional, just do the math.

A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to\nsee success with your product or service.

This is a simple, but strong guarantee.\nHere are the four types of guarantees. I’ll go over them in theory then we will apply them.\n1) Unconditional Guarantees\nAs I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional, and “anti-” guarantees. Unconditional are the strongest guarantees.\nThey're basically a trial where they pay first then see if they like it. This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you will have\nsome people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.\n2) Conditional Guarantees\nConditional guarantees include “terms and conditions” to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on.\nIn general, you want these to be “better than money back” guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you\nwant to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment. These also can have a very\npowerful effect on getting clients results. If you know the key actions someone must take in order to be successful, make those\npart of the conditional guarantee. I",

That is an ideal we can all aspire towards. And just fyi if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised the vast majority of people will take the\noutcome.\n3) Anti-Guarantees\nAnti-guarantees are when you explicitly state “all sales are final.” You will want to own this position. You must come up\nwith a creative “reason why” the sales are final. Typically, you’ll want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your\npart that a consumer could immediately understand and think “Yes, that makes sense.” These types of guarantees are especially\nimportant with items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given.\n4) Implied Guarantees\nImplied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare,\nprofitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etc are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I\ndon’t get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of “If I do a great job, I will be very well\ncompensated.” These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that\nyou will get compensated when you do perform.\nStacking Guarantees\nAn experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees.

I wanted to give in. Years of emotions were bottled below the surface.\nYears of ignoring my reality and lack of success. Years of putting off how I felt just focusing on moving forward. The\npressure was shooting to the surface. I could feel it.\n“We did it,” I said.\nLeila, my wife now, looked up at me. She was in the kitchen making dinner and stopped, spatula in hand. “What do you\nmean?”\n“We did it. We hit $100k.” I could barely get the words out because I didn’t want the tears to break through the tremble in\nmy voice.\n“Like revenue?”\n“No. Like in our personal bank accounts.”\n“Holy shit really?! That’s amazing!!”\nShe ran over to me, disregarding the food on the stove, and wrapped her arms around my neck, spatula still in hand.\n“I’m so proud of you”\nShe squeezed me. I slumped into her arms. It was like every knot in my body that I had been holding onto melted all at once.\nI could barely contain myself. But when I think back to it, the feeling I had wasn’t happiness. It was relief. I’d moved from fear\nto security. I’d traded feeling like a failure everyday, watching my work and effort yield nothing, to realizing a dream. The\nconstant anxiety and fear of “what are we gonna do” finally be replaced by something else. I finally had time to let myself feel\nsomething.\nI felt like this “struggle” chapter of life was finally over.\n“Look,” I said. “It’s for real”\nI nuzzled my head out of Leila’s arms. I",

It wasn’t\n“profit” that was still in the business account, only to be taken out later by some unforeseen emergency. It wasn’t “earmarked”\nmoney that had to be used to pay off some debt. It was ours. For real.\n“Babe,” I said. “We could fuck up and not make another dollar for three straight years, and still be okay.”\nAt the time, $33,000 per year was more than enough for us to live at our current expenses for three years and some.\nYears of ups and downs. Years of ploughing money into my business(es) only to watch it vanish in overhead, payroll, and\nmistakes. Years of seminars, courses, workshops, coaching programs, masterminds . . . had F-I-N-A-L-L-Y turned into wealth.\nIt felt like I had broken into a new plane. The relative increase in wealth was more than I ever felt.\nTens of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was, and still is, the richest I have ever felt in my life.

Why you should pick a normal or growing market, and why niches get you riches.\n3. Why you should charge a lot of money.\n4. How to charge a lot of money using the four core value drivers.\n5. How to create your value offer in five steps.\n6. How to stack the value, deliver it, and make it profitable.\n7. How to shift the demand curve in your favor using scarcity,\n8. How to use urgency to decrease the action threshold of buyers\n9. How to strategically use bonuses to increase the demand of your offer\n10. How to completely reverse buyer risk with a creative guarantee.\n11. How to name it in a way that resonates with your avatar.\nYou now have a valuable, high margin, de-commoditized grand slam offer. This is the first building block of a wonderful\nbusiness — a product or service that people desperately want and truly solves their problem. For many, this will be enough to\nmake far more sales, at higher prices, with more profit. Your first true grand slam offer should be able to get you to your first\n$100,000.

Meaning, if you\nstructure your promotions correctly, you should never have to pay for a new customer again. That is the subject of\nAcquisition.com Volume II $100M: Lead Generation.\nFinal Thoughts\nEntrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits. To advance, I find that we must determine which\nskills, beliefs, and character traits we lack. Most times, we simply need to improve. And the only way to do that is through\nlearning from experience and/or high quality sources. I have received terrible advice from people who were ahead of me at the\ntime. And though experience is the best teacher, she is not the kindest.\nIt is my most sincere hope that what I produce provides the guidance I so desperately needed when I was coming up on my\nentrepreneurial journey. And I wish I could cover it all in a single book (for my sake and yours). But, to do you the service I\nwish I had had, I cannot. The devil is in the details. Excellence exists in the depth of knowledge and nuances. That’s what\nseparates the greats from everyone else. I hope that in all the content I produce you see my dedication to this detail and nuance\nthat makes all the difference. These lessons were hard won.\nI hope you’ve enjoyed this first volume in my offers series. Before we move forward into volume two, where we’ll be\nfocusing on lead generation, as mentioned above, I wanted to circle back to where we started. A",
