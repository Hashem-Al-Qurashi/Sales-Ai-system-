I learned the hard\nway, and my businesses suffered for a long time because of it.\nLet me explain. The market is continuously growing. The stock market grows at 9 percent per year. If we aren't growing at\n9 percent per year, we are falling behind. “Maintenance,” in the most generic sense, would be 9 percent growth year over year.\nFurthermore, if you’re in a growing marketplace, then you might have to grow at 20-30 percent per year, just to keep up, or\nrisk falling behind. So you can see how maintenance is a myth.\nSo, then,what does it take to grow? Thankfully, just three simple things:\n1. Get more customers\n2. Increase their average purchase value\n3. Get them to buy more times\nThat’s it.\nSure, there are lots of ways to acquire customers and zillions of ways to increase order value and purchase frequency, but,\nsimply put, that’s it. Those are the only three ways to grow.\nExample: If I sell 10 clients a month, and a client is worth $1,000 to me over their lifetime (through avg cart value x avg\nnumber of purchases), then my business will cap at $10,000/mo (10 x $1,000).\n10 New Clients/mo x $1000 Lifetime Value = $10,000/mo max revenue.\nIf you want to grow, you’ve got to either sell more clients every month (while maintaining suitable margins) or have them\nbe worth more (by increasing the profit per purchase or number of times they buy). That’s it.",

When I stood in that Las Vegas penthouse in my “beast mode” t-shirt I was clueless\nabout such terms. Let me help you be better than, well, me.\nGross Profit: The revenue minus the direct cost of servicing an ADDITIONAL customer. If I sell lotion for $10 and it\ncosts me $2, my gross profit is $8 or 80 percent. If I sell agency services for $1,000/mo and it costs me $100/mo in labor to\nrun that client's advertising, then my gross profit is $900 or 90 percent. Note: This is not net profit. Net profit is what’s left\nover after all expenses are paid, not just the direct costs of fulfillment.\nLifetime Value: The gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer. This is gross profit multiplied by the\nnumber of purchases an average customer will make over their lifetime. Using the example above, if the average customer\nstays five months, and they pay $1,000/mo while it costs me $100 per month to fulfill, then their lifetime value is $4,500.\nHere’s the breakdown:\nRevenue: ($1,000/mo * 90% Gross Margin * 5 months) = $4,500 Lifetime Value (LTV)\nNote that the indirect costs, like admin, software, rent, etc., are not included in LTV.\nNote: You will find different definitions for lifetime value depending on the source. The biggest difference is that some\nsources only count total revenue, while others focus on gross profit over the lifespan. I focus on gross profit. You may also see\nme refer to this as LTGP Lifetime Gross Profit in other texts for clarity’s sake.\nValue-Driven vs. P",

I’ve spent (and continue to spend) hundreds of\nhours on calls and in-person meetings consulting entrepreneurs on crafting their offers. I have seen the ones that take off into the\nstratosphere and those that fizzle.\nHaving a Grand Slam offer makes it almost impossible to lose. But why? What gives it such an impact? In short, having a\nGrand Slam Offer helps with all three of the requirements for growth: getting more customers, getting them to pay more, and\ngetting them to do so more times.\nHow? It allows you to differentiate yourself from the marketplace. In other words, it allows you to sell your product based\non VALUE not on PRICE.\nCommoditized = Price Driven Purchases (race to the bottom)\nDifferentiated = Value Driven Purchases (sell in a category of one with no comparison. Yes, market matters, which I will\nexpound on in the next chapter)\nA commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it’s prone to purchases based on\n“price” instead of “value.” If all products are “equal,” then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. In other words, if\na prospect compares your product to another and thinks “these are pretty much the same, I’ll buy the cheaper one,” then they\ncommoditized you. How embarrassing! But really . . . it’s one of the worst experiences a value-driven entrepreneur can have.\nThis is a massive problem for the entrepreneur because commodities are valued at the point of market efficiency.

So you can sell at whatever price you\nget the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else. As a result, it gets you more customers, at higher ticket prices,\nfor less money. If you like fancy marketing terms, it breaks down like this:\n1. Increased Response Rates (think clicks)\n2. Increased Conversion (think sales)\n3. Premium Prices (think charging a lot of money).\nHaving a Grand Slam Offer increases your response rates to advertisements (aka more people will click or take an action\non an advertisement they see containing a Grand Slam Offer).\nIf you pay the same amount for eyeballs but 1) more people respond, 2) more of those responses buy, and 3) they buy for\nhigher prices, your business grows.\nI’ve “struck gold” on my share of offers. Not because I've got some superpower, but because I’ve just done this a lot of\ntimes (and failed even more). I sorted through the crap that chronically fails and pocketed all the stuff that reproducibly\nsucceeds (and put it in this book) .\nHere’s the key takeaway from all this: a business does the same work in both cases (with a commoditized or a Grand Slam\nOffer). The fulfillment is the same.

Low prices! ….Best taste!”\nThe students kept going until eventually they had run out of answers. They looked at each other waiting for the professor to\nspeak. The room finally fell quiet.\nThe professor smiled and replied, “A starving crowd.”\nYou could have the worst hot dogs, terrible prices, and be in a terrible location, but if you’re the only hot dog stand in town\nand the local college football game breaks out, you’re going to sell out. That’s the value of a starving crowd.\nAt the end of the day, if there is a ton of demand for a solution, you can be mediocre at business, have a terrible offer, and\nhave no ability to persuade people, and you can still make money.\nAn example of this was the toilet paper shortage at the beginning of Covid-19. There was no offer. The pricing was\natrocious. And there was no compelling sales pitch. But because the crowd was so big and so starving, rolls of toilet paper\nwere going for $100 or more. That’s the value of a starving crowd.\nSelling Newspapers\nA good friend of mine, Lloyd, owned a software business that served newspapers for almost a decade. They set up digital\nad services on newspaper websites with a few clicks and instantly helped them sell a whole new ad product. He only charged\nthem a percentage of the revenue he added. So if they made nothing, neither did he. It was pure gain for the papers and a great\noffer.\nBut, despite having a great offer and natural sales ability, his business began to decline. B",

Finally, after\nyears of fighting an uphill battle in his market, he realized his market was the source of his problems and decided to downsize\nhis company.\nDon’t worry — this story has a second half.

They’re in massive pain. There are\nplenty of them, and it's constantly adding new people. This is a great market!”\nHe just forgot a crucial point: your audience needs to be able to afford the service you’re charging them for. Make sure\nyour targets have the money, or access to the amount of money, needed to buy your services at the prices you require to make it\nworth your time.\n3) Easy to Target\nLet’s say you have a perfect market, but no way of finding the people who comprise it. Well, making a Grand Slam Offer\nwill be difficult. I make my life easier by looking for easy-to-target markets. Examples of this are avatars that have\nassociations they belong to, mailing lists, social media groups, channels they all watch, etc. If our potential customers are all\ngathered together somewhere, then we can market to them. If searching them out, however, is like finding needles in a haystack,\nthen it can be very difficult to get your offer in front of any potentially interested eyes.\nThis point is tactical. It is reality, not theoretical. For instance, you may want to serve rich doctors. But if your ads are\nbeing displayed to nursing students, your offer will fall on deaf ears, no matter how good it is. M",

Declining markers are like headwinds.\nThey make all efforts harder. This was Lloyd's example.

Why? Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more\npain as they are nearer their deaths (pain), have more buying power (money), and are easy to find (targeting). Lastly, at the time\nof this writing, there are more people turning 65 each year than turning 20 (growing).\nThat is the idea. Think about what you are good at in regards to health, wealth, and relationships. Then think about who\nmight value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what you want (money), and can be found\neasily (targeting). As long as those three criteria are strong and the market isn't shrinking, you’ll be in good shape.\nBut how important to your success is finding a “great market” versus a “normal market” versus a “bad market?” The\nanswer: it actually depends.

You could essentially move down the line\nfrom left to right in order of importance. A “great” rating on a higher-order piece overpowers anything else lower on the\npriority scale. A “normal” rating moves the buck to the next part of the equation. A “bad” stops the equation unless a “great”\nfrom a higher priority component nullifies it.

If you’re on the corner hocking hot dogs when the bars close up at 2am, with mobs of starving drunk folks, you’re\ngonna sell out your hotdogs.\nExample #2 (most of us): If you are in a normal market and have a Grand Slam Offer (great), you can make tons of money",

In order to be massively successful, you would\nhave to be exceptionally good at persuasion. Then and only then will you succeed, with your persuasive skills serving as the\nfulcrum of your success. Heck, many empires have been built by exceptional persuaders. It’s just the hardest path to follow and\nrequires the most effort and learning. Nailing your offer helps you shortcut this path to success. Otherwise, you will just have a\nnormal business that takes exceptional skill to be successful (nothing wrong with that, but probably not what you signed up for).\nCommit to the Niche\nI have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market “Don’t make me niche slap you.”\nToo often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries one offer in one market, doesn't make a million dollars, then\nmistakenly thinks “this is a bad market.” Most times that’s not actually the case.

So, pick then commit.\nRiches Are In The Niches\nThe other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make.\nSimply put, niching down will make you far more money.\n\nAuthor Note - When To Broaden (Advice For Most People)\nFor most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money. After that, it will depend on how narrow the niche is, or, what is\ncalled TAM (total addressable market). A business can really only grow to meet the total addressable market. That being said, for most people, getting to\n$10M per year is already a top .4% achievement (only 1 in 250 businesses achieve this). So for 99.6 percent of readers below $10M per year, it’s almost\nalways easier to serve fewer clients more narrowly. But if you want to go beyond that, you may (depending on the size of your TAM) have to broaden\nyour audience by going up market, down market, or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.\nFor context, many companies expanded to $30M+ per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If\nyou are at $1M or $3M, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong.

We could tie their increase to even one more\nsale or one more deal and it would be worth more. But there are a lot of sales people. So this might be a $99 product. Neat, but\nwe can do better.\nSo let’s go down another level of niching and call our product…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps.”\nFollowing the same principles of specificity, now we know our sales people probably have very experienced deals and\ncommissions. A single sale would easily net this salesman $500 (or more), so it would be easy to justify a $499 price tag. This\nis already a 25x increase in price for almost an identical product. I could stop here, but I’m going to go one step further.\nLet’s just niche down one last level…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps.”\nBoom.\nT",

Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.\nIf you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It\ntakes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It\nmeans your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You’ll never become world class if you\nstop after a failed attempt.\nIf you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll\nlikely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set — the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into\naccount pain, money, targeting, and growth — in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes\ntwice.\nHaving established how to nail a market, let’s get back to pricing.

So why on earth copy them?\nPricing where the market is means you’re pricing for market efficiency. Over time, in an efficient marketplace, more\ncompetitors enter offering “a little more for a little less,” until eventually no one can provide any more for any less. At this\npoint, a market reaches perfect efficiency, and the business owners participating make just enough at the end of the month to\nkeep going. The bottom 10-20 percent of operators get washed out or lose the will to fight. Then fresh business owners enter\nwith no idea and repeat the process of their forefathers.

Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible. They rated them, unsurprisingly,\nin order of their price, with the most expensive being the “best,” the second most expensive being “second best,” and the third,\ncheapest option, being rated as “cheap wine.”\nWhat the tasters didn’t know is that the researchers gave them the exact same wine all three times. Yet, the tasters reported\na wide discrepancy between the “high priced” wine and the “cheap” wine. This has deep implications for the direct\nrelationship between value and price.\nIn essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more\nallure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be\nslightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, “This is so much more\nexpensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.”\nThat is how you create a category of one.

My fee was the 100% of the revenue I would bring in.\nAt our peak, we were turning around eight gyms a month. This quickly became a logistical nightmare. After the wear and\ntear of living in motels month after month after month, I thought to myself there has to be a better way to do this.\nOne month, there was a gym we were scheduled to go fly out to. But, I simply didn’t want to do it. So I told them we were\ngoing to cancel the engagement. The gym owner practically threatened me to help him. So I said I would help him, but he would\nhave to do all the work, but I would show him how.\nWithin thirty days, this gym had made almost $44,000 in new up front cash collected sales (4x their previous month). As\nsoon as I saw that my process could be duplicated from afar, without me having to fly people in. . .our business exploded. I had\nfound the missing link because my travel schedule was no longer a constraint. We went on to sell 4000+ more gyms over the\nnext few years (and counting) using a done-with-you rather than a done-for-you model. But. . .back to premium pricing.\nWhen I entered the space, low-price competitors offered full-service marketing for $500 per month, with a single highprice competitor charging $5,000 for his product.\nI wanted to be the premium price leader. I wanted to be so expensive that it created allure around what we were doing. So,\nwe came in at three-times the highest-priced player and 32 times more than the lower-priced players.

And I\nwas selling this to grown men as a kid in his twenties, telling them I was going to help them make more money. This was\npossible because my conviction was stronger than their skepticism. How?\nBased a voluntary survey taken at our last full company event, with 158 gyms responding, we found that a Gym Launch gym\nwho has been in our program for 11 months will experience the following average improvements:\nTop Line Revenue Growth: +$19,932/mo (+$239,000/yr)\nRecurring Revenue Growth: +$13,339/mo (+$160,068/yr)\nBottom Line Growth (Profit): From $2,943/mo to $8,940/mo (3.1x!)\nClient Growth: +67\nChurn (% of clients who leave each month): From 10.7 percent to 6.8 percent\nRetail Sales: +$4,400/mo in retail product sales revenue\nPrices: From $129/mo to $167/mo\nThe survey just proved what I already knew. I had complete conviction in our product.\nI knew it worked. I had outworked my self-doubt.\nSummary Points\nWhat should you take from this?\nFirst and foremost, charge a premium. It will allow you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful. We\nwere able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry. In a real way, we were\ncharging on a fraction of what our clients made using our system. This is important. Our clients still got a deal. T",

That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can\ncharge these rates and get people to say yes.\nFrom this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about “what's fair.” Every enormous company in the world\ncharges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except\nthey don’t mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they\ndon’t mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king’s ransom for your eyeballs,\nand it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You need to have a big discrepancy between\nwhat something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.\nMany entrepreneurs believe that charging “too much” is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than\nyour product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a\nhundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the\nprospect. That is the power of value.

So, in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than\noffers that help them look good.\nI once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept. He explained how his wife, Collette, at first hearing about this\nstatus concept, rejected it. She claimed she wasn’t driven by status and would never want to drive a Lamborghini. Instead, she\nfavored her minivan. But, after talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status\namongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show she was a good mother (increase in status). So it’s not about the\nmoney, it's about the status (the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or\nprofessionally). Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects\ndrooling.\n\nPro Tip: Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others\nWhen writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect’s achievement. Connect\n\n\fthe dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards.

For example, if we have two products or services that both help make someone beautiful, it will be the\nlikelihood of achievement, time delay, and effort required that will differentiate the perceived value of each offer.\nSimply put: if two things make someone beautiful, what makes one worth $50,000 and another $5? Answer: The extent of\nthe other three value variables.\n#2 Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal = Increase)\nThis was the last of the variables I added when trying to think through this framework a few years ago. I just felt like\nsomething was missing with only the other three.\nThen I realized people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this “the perceived likelihood of achievement.” In\nother words, “How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?”\nFor example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon’s 10,000th patient versus their first?\nIf you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient\never.\nSo you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only\nthing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want.\nBoth surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery (if anything, the guy who has done it 10,000 times would\nlikely get it done faster and still charge more).

Increasing a prospect’s conviction that your offer will “actually”\nwork for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to\nincrease value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what\nwe choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees (more on these later).\n#3 Time Delay (Goal = Decrease)\nTime delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when\nthey purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is.\nThere are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are shortterm experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen “along the way” and provide value.\nIt’s good to understand both. The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that\nmakes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way\nthat shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer. We want\nclients to have a big emotional win early (as close as possible to their purchase). This gives them the emotional buy in and the\nmomentum to “see it through” to their ultimate goal.\nFor example, it takes a while to add an extra $239,000 per year to a gym. B",

So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.\nConvergent & Divergent Thinking\nIn simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and\nconverge on a singular answer. Think math.\nExample:\nYou have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.\nIt takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).\nYou need to get to 110 sales . . .\nHow many sales people must you hire?\nDeduced Information:\n1 salesperson = 100 calls\n4 calls = 1 close\n100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls\n25 closes per rep\nGoal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4\nSince you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.\nANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.\nMath problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to\nthink this way. That is because it’s easy to grade.\nBut life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a\nsingle problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking,\nyou can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others.

I felt worthless, and I didn't\nknow what to do. Thankfully, during this time, I was in groups with other gym owners, and I started hearing about marketers\nand books. I devoured everything I could. And as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy’s books, I was hooked.\nIn his books, he talked about making “irresistible offers.” Again, this theme of “making an offer so good people would feel\nstupid to say no” kept re-appearing.

I would even do the first onboarding meeting with\nclients to get them started. In short, I did everything. I took on all the risk.\nThey only had to put down $500 to “reserve” their date, which I made refundable at the end of their launch. So they had 0\nfinancial risk, 0 time risk, 0 effort, and the deal was, I got to keep all the up front cash collected from selling their services, and\nthey got clients for free. You can imagine how this was a pretty compelling offer.\nOn my own, I was able to sell about $100,000/mo in up front cash for myself. So these deals were very lucrative for me.\nOver time, I scaled that to a team of 8 guys selling every month. But this began to wear on me and the team. It was at that point\nthat I realized that if I were to simply teach them how to do what I did, I could charge maybe a third of what I would normally\nmake, but I would be able to help hundreds of gyms a month instead of eight. And, I could do it all sleeping in my own bed\nevery night.\nMy promise was fundamentally the same: I will fill your gym in 30 days. It was simply the how and what I did that\nchanged.

As a result, I lost many sales.\nOne month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got\ninto the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn’t work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this\nsale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded “I’ll\nmake you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal.

Next, I look at the cost of providing\nthese solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low\nvalue items.\nIf you aren’t sure what’s high value, go through the value equation and ask yourself which of these things will this person:\n1. Financially value\n2. Cause them to believe they will be likely to succeed\n3. Make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and sacrifice\n4. Help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want with far less time investment.\nWhat should remain are offer items that are 1) low cost, high value and 2) high cost, high value.\nExample: Let’s say I moved in with someone and did their shopping, exercising, and cooking for them. They would\nprobably believe they would definitely lose weight. But I am not willing to do that for any amount of money short of a gazillion\ndollars.\nThe next question becomes, is there a lesser version of this experience that I can deliver at scale?\nJust take one step back at a time until you arrive at something that has a time commitment or cost you are willing to live\nwith (or, obviously, massively increase your price so it becomes worth it for you — i.e., the gazillion dollars to live with\nsomeone).\nIf there’s one type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it’s creating high value, “one to many” solutions.

We artificially increase the demand for our\nproducts and services through some sort of persuasive communication. When we increase the demand, we can sell more units.\n\n\fWhen we decrease supply, we can sell those units for more money. The “perfect profit combination” is lots of demand, and\nvery little supply, or perceived supply. The process of enhancing your core offer is designed to do both of these things:\nincrease demand and decrease perceived supply so that you can sell the same products for more money than you otherwise\ncould, and in higher volumes than you otherwise would (over a longer time horizon).\n\nAuthor Note:\nThis assumes a regular business who is not trying to gain mass market penetration for some other strategic advantage.",

In fact, I heard this quote that I love from Naval Ravikant: “Desire is a\ncontract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” It follows, therefore, that we only want things we\ndo not have. As soon as we have them, our desire for them disappears. Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand (or\ndesire), we must decrease or delay satisfying the desires of our prospects. We must sell fewer units than we otherwise can. Let\nthat sit with you for a second.\nConsider this example. We promote some two-day workshop that is upcoming. First we whisper that it’s coming. Then we\ntease it with some of the benefits. Then we shout that it is launching in a week. Then, when we launch this amazing workshop.\nWe have two supply-demand scenarios:\nScenario one: We sell 10 units at $500 each (sell entire pyramid at price all say yes)\nScenario two: We sell two one-day workshops 1-on-1 for $5000 each.

Instead, I’ve found demand to be fractal (80/20). In other words, one fifth of the prospects are willing to pay five\ntimes the price (or more).\nIn the example, I might have ten people willing to pay $500, but two of them willing to pay $5000. So, I would make more,\nhave lower costs (more profits), provide more value, and increase the demand in the remaining prospect base by selling fewer\nunits. Think about how exclusive scenario one vs scenario two would feel. Think about all the people who would want to\npurchase, but would not be able to. Would this increase or decrease their desire? It would increase it, of course.\nOn top of that, if people see that others who ‘were able to get in’ are loving it, it would further increase their desire. And\nthe next time, they would act with more urgency, and be willing to pay more for the same thing than they originally did. So now,\nin the aftermath of our second scenario, we still have eight people who have unsatisfied desire. This increases their desire\nfurther. And to boot, we now have new prospects who weren't in the original pool who now want what we have.\n\nThe next time we promote scenario two, we then open three spots at the same price and sell them all (still leaving some\nprospects with pent up demand!).

All desire has been satisfied. When you “pull the trigger too early,”\neach successive instance we promote, we sell even fewer. Eventually, we run out of sufficient demand to make even a single\nsale. This is the sad state many businesses find themselves in always trying to generate more demand to make another quick\nsale.\nHormozi Law: The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. “The longer the runway, the bigger the plane\nthat can take off.”\nWe must endeavor to keep our supply (and satisfaction of desire) under the demand that we are able to generate. This\nmaximizes profits and keeps desire ravenous in our customer base. This is the real key to never going hungry.\nSummary Points\nThe reason I titled this sub-section “Delicate Dance of Desire” is that supply and demand are inversely correlated (in\ntheory). If you satisfy zero desire (provide zero supply), you will not make money, and eventually leave people feeling\nrejected (Note: it takes much longer than you think).\nConversely, if you satisfy all the demand, you will kill your golden goose, and not know where your next meal will come\nfrom. Mastering supply and demand comes from the elegant dance between the two. If you sleep with your significant other\neveryday they have less desire than if you haven’t slept with them for a week. We want the ravenous prospect, not merely the\naroused.\nTherefore, understanding the interplay between these variables is key to enhancing your offer and the amount of profits you\nwill make over time.

This is where you publicly\nshare that you are only giving away X amount of products or can only handle Y new clients.\nFor example, if a musician drops a limited edition hoodie and says he only made 100 and they will never be made again,\nare you more or less likely to buy it than one that is always available? More likely, naturally. The idea that you can never get it\nagain makes it more desirable.\nThis is an example of scarcity. I",

They\nsend only 1-2 of each piece to each store so every store has a different selection and every item is the last or second to last\nitem in stock. This allows them to price far above market and turn buying impulses into purchases.\nServices\nWith services, especially if you want to consistently get customers, it can be a little trickier to use scarcity. But I will show\nyou a few simple ways to employ scarcity ethically to increase your take rates on offers. These all have similar elements with\nvery slight tweaks. I'm enumerating these because one of these might mentally fit your business model more than others.\n1. Total Business Cap - Only accepting….X Clients. Only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going). This\nputs a cap on how many clients you service but also keeps them in it. You create a waiting list for new prospects. The moment\nthe door opens, they jump right in and price resistance disappears. Periodically, you can increase capacity by 10-20% then cap\nit again. This works well for your highest tiers or service levels.\na) This is like saying “My agency only will service twenty-five customers total. P",

Growth Rate Cap - Only accepting X clients per week (on-going) “We only accept 5 new clients per week and we\nalready have the first 3 spots taken. I have 6 more calls this week, so you can take the spot or one of my next calls and you can\nwait until we reopen.” I have used this method since the beginning of my business. I always knew what my capacity was per\nweek, and simply chose to let our prospects know how many openings we had left. This banks on the fact that you can only\nhandle a certain amount of new clients anyways, on a regular basis, so you might as well let them know it.\n3. Cohort Cap - Only accepting….X clients per class or cohort. Similar to the above, except done on whatever cadence\nyou desire. Only accepting X amount per class or cohort over a given period is another way of thinking about it. Imagine you\nonly start clients monthly or quarterly. This helps you get some cadences in place in your business operationally while also\nallowing your sales team some legitimate scarcity. Example: “We take on 100 clients 4 times a year.

But I promise you this - if\nyou want to immediately make a lot of money, create a very exclusive service level based on access to you (yes, unscalable), that you cap at a tiny number.\nPrice it very high. Then, tell people. You will make more money than you thought possible. These also tend to be some of the best clients. And limit your\ndelivery to something that you don’t hate. For me, I hate emails and messages but dont mind zoom calls. Make it work for your working style. The cream of\nthe crop (the 1% of 1% will adjust and take action).\n\nPro Tip - Once You’re Out, You Can Never Come Back\nYou can create scarcity by also capping your service level and saying that if they leave than can never return. This type of scarcity makes people think\nextra hard about leaving. I started doing this with my gyms early on. Then I was in a mastermind that employed this. Then I started using it in my higher\nlevel of Gym Lords. This works best with small groups (like the above example).

It’s small things like this that nudge\npeople to take the action they know they should take anyways.\nObviously the less frequently you kick off new customers, the more powerful this is. For example, if you only start clients\ntwo times a year, people will be very inclined to sign up, especially as the date approaches. Even starting new clients every\nother week can confer this urgency nudge.\n\nWhat if I lose sales by turning business away?\nJust like guarantees, there is always a fear that you will make less money by employing this strategy. We are afraid that we will lose sales we would\nhave otherwise made. Every experienced marketer on the planet will tell you - it is a fear, and it is unfounded. The biggest sales on a week long campaign\nor launch happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60%).

I personally love having the dates that I am running a promotion through on my landing pages and in my copy.\nI want it to be visible everywhere.

Deadlines drive decisions. By simply having these, you can point to them and let human beings\npush themselves over the edge so as not to miss out.\n\nPro Tip - Local Businesses: This is my number one strategy for local businesses.

It allows businesses that sell clients year round to still use urgency. For example, “Yes, let’s get you\nstarted today so you can take advantage of the discount you came in for. I’m not sure how long we will be running it as we\nchange them every 4 weeks or so, and this is one of the better ones we have run in a while.”\nThis creates some fear of missing out on the promotion (or discount or bonuses), rather than your actual service. It would\nbe a lie to say that if you own a roofing business you won’t service them if they buy after the date. But, if you talk specifically\nabout the promotion you can often elicit the same urgency on buying in the prospect while maintaining your integrity — winwin. You can interchange a pricing promotion, discount, or added bonuses like free install or free onboarding or an extra\nworkshop (valued at $1,000) if they buy now. These are all things you can swap around your core offer to create urgency.\n\nPro Tip - Clean Your Pipeline With Every Price Change: If you ever really are planning on raising your prices (hopefully soon if you are reading this\nbook!) then you can always clean out your pipeline by letting people know “The price is going up! So get in now!” Never raise your prices without letting\npeople know. It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from the people in the pipeline who were on the fence.",

The opportunity itself has a ticking time clock,\nas all great opportunities do. Every second someone delays, they miss out on disproportionate gains.\nExample: If I was explaining an arbitrage opportunity between buying products on ebay and selling them on amazon, this\nmarket inefficiency would over time correct itself. The sooner someone acts the better it will be for them. This could be true\nfor selling someone on the opportunity of trading crypto currencies, buying a stock, getting into a new platform to advertise\nbefore competitors jump on the bandwagon. Highly competitive job environments often get job offers that are “exploding\noffers” everyday they wait to take the job, their pay or bonuses decrease. This forces prospects to make fast decisions rather\nthan try and “wait it out” to see if they get a better offer.\nAll of these examples show opportunities that decay with time, so if you find yourself in front of an opportunity like this,\nmake sure to emphasize it!\nSummary Points\nAdding a deadline and incorporating one or multiple forms of urgency will get more people to take action than would\notherwise.

In this chapter, I’m going to cover: what to offer, how to pick them, how to value them, how to\npresent them, how to price them.\nThe main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its\ncomponent parts and stacked as bonuses (see image). The entirety of our offer we came up with at the end of the last section.\nThis section is about how to present those pieces in what order. For example, I may in fact do lots of things in my service, but\nuntil I enumerate them, they are unknown. This is why every infomercial of all time continues on with “but wait….there’s\nmore!”\nThey would not use these techniques unless they were effective, as every second of air time costs money and must be\njustified with ROI. You’ll also notice that if you watch those old infomercials, they would sell one knife for $38.95 then\ninclude 37 other knives, sharpeners, pans, and guarantees to beat the prospect into submission. They establish the price, then\nthey expand upon it until you feel it’s such a good deal it would be stupid to pass it up.\nThe reason this works is we are increasing the prospect’s price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered\ninstead of cutting the price. We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that\ndiscrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their\nwallet in their pocket.\nW",

It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding\nbonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.\n\nPresenting Bonuses 1-on-1 vs Group Selling\nThere are key differences between pitching to a group versus a single person. Group selling is beyond the scope of this\nbook. But I want to at least address when a bonus would be brought up in a 1-1 selling scenario. When selling one on one, you\nask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses. If they say yes, then after they have signed up, you let them know the\nadditional bonuses they're going to get.

Don’t feel weird about asking again. You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this\nconsolation was “Fair enough.” People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another,\nthen another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you.\nIf you recall from our “Trim and Stack” chapter, each of those deliverables is now being weaponized and presented at the\nperfect time. We’re going to provide all these bonuses to them anyways, but it increases the perception of our offer’s value by\nlayering these bonuses one at a time.\nBonus Bullets\nThat being said, there are a few key things to remember when offering bonuses:\n1. Always offer them (you can use the bulleted bundle we came up with at the end of Section III)\n2. Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title\n3. Tell them:\na) How it relates to their issue\nb) What it is\nc) How you discovered it, or what you had to do to create it\nd) How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience\ni) Faster, easier or less effort/sacrifice (value equation)\n4. Provide some proof (this can be a stat, a past client, or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable\n5. Paint a vivid mental image of what their life will be like assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the\nbenefits\n6. Always ascribe a price tag to them and justify it\n7.

Therefore, reversing risk is an immediate way to make any offer more attractive. You will want\nto spend a disproportionate amount of time figuring out how you want to reverse it. That being said, how much more attractive\ncan a guarantee make an offer?\nJason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer 2-4x simply by changing\nthe quality of the guarantee. It’s that important.\nFrom an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees:\n1. Unconditional\n2. Conditional\n3. Anti-Guarantee\n4. Implied Guarantees.\nYou must always hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why.\nBut won’t people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?\nSometimes, but not usually. That being said, you must understand the math. If you close 130 percent as many people, and\nyour refund percentage doubles from 5 percent to 10 percent, you’ve still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that\nall goes to the bottom line.\nEx: 100 sales, 5 refunds (5%) = 95 Net Sales\nGuarantee Offer 130 sales, 13 refunds (10%)= 117 Net sales\n117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)\nDon't be emotional, just do the math. For a guarantee to not be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be 100 percent\noffset by people who refunded. So an absolute increase in sales of 5 percent would need to be offset by an absolute increase in\nrefunds of 5 percent (but that might be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely). S",

This is a simple, but strong guarantee.\nHere are the four types of guarantees. I’ll go over them in theory then we will apply them.\n1) Unconditional Guarantees\nAs I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional, and “anti-” guarantees. Unconditional are the strongest guarantees.\nThey're basically a trial where they pay first then see if they like it. This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you will have\nsome people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.\n2) Conditional Guarantees\nConditional guarantees include “terms and conditions” to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on.\nIn general, you want these to be “better than money back” guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you\nwant to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment. These also can have a very\npowerful effect on getting clients results. If you know the key actions someone must take in order to be successful, make those\npart of the conditional guarantee. I",

That is an ideal we can all aspire towards. And just fyi if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised the vast majority of people will take the\noutcome.\n3) Anti-Guarantees\nAnti-guarantees are when you explicitly state “all sales are final.” You will want to own this position. You must come up\nwith a creative “reason why” the sales are final. Typically, you’ll want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your\npart that a consumer could immediately understand and think “Yes, that makes sense.” These types of guarantees are especially\nimportant with items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given.\n4) Implied Guarantees\nImplied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare,\nprofitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etc are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I\ndon’t get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of “If I do a great job, I will be very well\ncompensated.” These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that\nyou will get compensated when you do perform.\nStacking Guarantees\nAn experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees.

This future paces the prospect into an outcome\nthey now believe is far more likely (since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for\nachievement).

That line made me a lot of\nmoney. I had two people take me up on it out of 4,000 sales in three and a half years.\nSatisfaction/No questions asked is the highest form of guarantee. It means we could do everything right and you could still\nask for your money back. As long as you know the math, you will typically make up for the refunds in spaces with higher and\nfaster closing on the sales side. But you have to be good at fulfilling your promises. If not, steer clear. I believe this offer\nworks much better in lower-ticket situations. It becomes very risky as you go into higher-ticket services with higher costs of\nfulfillment.\n\nPro Tip: Unconditional vs Conditional Based on Business Type\nBigger broader guarantees work better with lower ticket B2C businesses (many people just won't bother taking the time). The higher the ticket, and the\nmore business oriented it is, the more you want to steer towards specific guarantees. That may or may not include refunds, and may or may not have\nconditions.",

And this is a guarantee to add with a consumption\ncondition. That means they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee. A world class affiliate marketer Jason\nFladlien (who did $27M in a single day) recently used an amazing guarantee for a course he sold. He said “if you buy this\ncourse and spend $X on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your\nstore from you for $25,000 no questions asked.” He claimed that an additional $3M in sales came from this crazy guarantee on\na $2997 course. What’s more, he only gave 10 of these $25,000 refunds out. So the refund generated $2.75M in extra sales.\nThat’s what a crazy guarantee does for you.\nIn general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales. This really serves the purpose when you need\na lot of stuff to be done by your prospect, and, assuming those things are done, there’s a low chance of the result not being\nachieved. Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top. This guarantee will typically outperform\na traditional 30-day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions (sales minus refunds).\n[Conditional] Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You keep working for them free of charge until X is achieved.\nMy Take: This is probably my personal favorite guarantee of all time.

Likely, this is a very powerful thing that\nonce seen cannot be unseen, or once used cannot be taken away. Example: a line of code to improve your checkout experience\non a website. Once someone received this code, they could try and use it without paying you. Or a series of opening messages\nfor picking up girls, or opening sentences for messaging cold prospects. Things that are very valuable but incredibly easy to\nsteal after they’ve been seen/understood.\nMy Take: This can enhance the persuasiveness of the sale and the value of the product or service. It essentially implies\nthat the client is going to use it and see an immense benefit thereby exposing the business to vulnerability. It acts as a damaging\nadmission. We have an “all sales are final” policy, but that is because our product is so exclusive and so powerful that once\nused it cannot be unused.” Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is attention-worthy.\nSo instead of being wishy-washy, lean into the fact this thing works so well, and is so easy to copy, you must make all sales\nfinal. They’ll believe you even more if you take this position. “We are going to show you our proprietary process that we are\nusing right now to generate leads in our business. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We’re going to be exposing the inner workings\nof our business, as a result, all sales are final.” Note: strong reason why is needed here. Just make one up that sounds\ncompelling. T",

In my opinion, this is one of, if not THE most desirable setup. First because it makes you accountable to\nyour clients' results. Second it weeds out low performers. Perfect alignment between client and service provider fosters\ncollaboration and a long-term relationship. I'm a big fan. The drawbacks are tracking and collection.

This would be ideal for\na setup that takes a lot of time to get going.\nThese types of offers work well when you have quantifiable outcomes. The stronger, of course, is no guaranteed payment\nwithout performance.\nCreate Your Own Winning Guarantee\nReversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer. Experienced marketers spend as much time\ncrafting their guarantees as the deliverables themselves. It’s that important.\nI have personally used all the guarantees listed above (except for the hotel and phone call one, which I just saw and liked).\nBut you can come up with your own! The key is to identify a client’s biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. “What do\nthey not want to have happen if they pay you? What are they most afraid of?” Reverse their fears into a guarantee. Think of the\ntime, emotion, and outside costs associated with any program or service. The more specific and creative the guarantee is, the\nbetter.\nThat being said, guarantees are enhancers. They can enhance the magnetism or attraction of any offer, but they cannot make\na business. If a guarantee is used to cover up a poor sales team or a poor product, it will backfire into lots of refunds. No\nbueno.\nMy advice: Start selling service-based guarantees or setting up performance partnerships. This will make all sales final (so\nno fear from refunds). M",

The goal must be that upon hearing about your offer, your ideal prospects are interested enough to take\naction. Naming it properly is an integral part of this process.\nHere’s an example. Say you see a “Free Six-Week Stress Release Challenge” and a “Float Tank Center Session.” While\nthey may be the same thing, just named differently, you’re much more likely to respond to the first.\nNow here’s the rub: over time, offers fatigue. And in local markets, they fatigue even faster. Why? In a local market, it costs\nrelatively little to reach an entire population. On most platforms you can reach 1,000 people for about $20. So, if there are\n200,000 people in your addressable area, then it would only cost you $10,000 to reach all of them one time.\nImportant disclaimer: reaching an audience one time in no way means an offer is fatigued. Most people don’t even notice\nan offer on the first mention. That’s why you need to create new creative (videos, images) and new hooks, stories, and copy\naround the same offers. You can still use offers for a long time. But when we’re talking about years of use, not months, offers\ncan eventually fatigue.\nOver time you can rename the offer to refresh it.

          "text": "I follow this variation framework because most of the time it’s the first handful of items that need to be changed. Typically,\nthey need to be changed again and again without touching anything on the bottom of the list.\nFor example, when ads fatigue, we don’t change our entire business; we just run the same ad again with a different video or\nimage. Once that stops working, we change it again. Eventually you need to change the words in your ads. And repeat the\nprocess. Then, and only then, would you change the wrapper.\nLet’s say we change from a Six-Week Stress Release Challenge to a 42-Day Relaxing Holidays Challenge for a massage\ncenter. Same core offer, just a different wrapper. Then, of course, you could change the duration of your offer - six weeks to 28\ndays or eight weeks, etc. The lower on the list you go, the more operationally heavy it is, so really be sure you have exhausted\nthe earlier “lighter” ways of varying your offer.\nOnce you’ve monetized an offer, rarely should you change it. Just rinse and repeat over and over and over again. This can\nbe hard because we are entrepreneurs and love change. Change here usually just creates inefficiency and operational drag,\ncosting you money. No bueno.\nSo use your entrepreneurial ADD on the “wrapper” first - the “look and feel” of the offer (copy, creative, headlines). Then\nchange the seasonality of the offer. Then change the duration. If you’re still stuck, change what you are giving away for free or\ndiscount. Change the entire machine behind it only as a last resort and for a darn good reason, especially once you get traction.\nBut how do you get initial traction? Good question. T",

It’s easier to get to work, but harder to keep working or\nscale. And the reason is - in local markets, it’s easier because there’ is trust in the familiar. So selling in- person at higher prices in a local market is\ninherently easier. It means you will convert a much higher percentage of your leads. This makes marketing work most of the time.\nThe downside of local marketing is that offers fatigue rapidly because there is only a limited radius that a local business can serve. To reference an\nearlier concept, the TAM (total addressable market) for a brick & mortar is only its immediate radius (most times). So by extension, the smaller the radius,\nthe faster offers fatigue. This is the double-edged sword of local.\nLearning to rapidly variate my offers, headlines, and creative when I had my local businesses was a cornerstone skill that made my expansion to\nnational level advertising much easier for me. So if you are in a local market, just remember you aren’t going to change the value stack of your offer. You\nare just going to change the way it looks to the marketplace in your marketing.",

          "text": "ENHANCING THE OFFER: BONUSES\n\"It's all gravy baby\"\nPLAY ON AN OLD ENGLISH SAYING.\nhave to give special thanks to Jason Fladlien for my renewed appreciation for bonuses. They are so powerful that they earned an entire chapter. In this chapter, I'm going to cover: what to offer, how to pick them, how to value them, how to present them, how to price them.\nThe main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses (see image). The entirety of our offer we came up with at the end of the last section. This section is about how to present those pieces in what order. For example, I may in fact do lots of things in my service, but until I enumerate them, they are unknown. This is why every infomercial of all time continues on with \"but wait….there's more!\"\nThey would not use these techniques unless they were effective, as every second of air time costs money and must be justified with ROI. You'll also notice that if you watch those old infomercials, they would sell one knife for $38.95 then include 37 other knives, sharpeners, pans, and guarantees to beat the prospect into submission. They establish the price, then they expand upon it until you feel it's such a good deal it would be stupid to pass it up.\nThe reason this works is we are increasing the prospect's price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered instead of cutting the price. We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket.\nWe are now going to present that \"stack\" of deliverables that we assembled earlier in a way that makes them irresistible.\nPro Tip: Add Bonuses Instead of Discounting Whenever Possible on Core Offers\nWhenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.",

Group selling is beyond the scope of this book. But I want to at least address when a bonus would be brought up in a 1-1 selling scenario. When selling one on one, you ask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses. If they say yes, then after they have signed up, you let them know the additional bonuses they're going to get. This creates a wow experience and reinforces their decision to buy.\nOn the other hand, if the person does not buy after the first ask, then you present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, then ask again. Don't feel weird about asking again. You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this consolation was \"Fair enough.\" People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you.\nIf you recall from our \"Trim and Stack\" chapter, each of those deliverables is now being weaponized and presented at the perfect time. We're going to provide all these bonuses to them anyways, but it increases the perception of our offer's value by layering these bonuses one at a time.",

Always offer them (you can use the bulleted bundle we came up with at the end of Section III)\n2. Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title\n3. Tell them:\na) How it relates to their issue\nb) What it is\nc) How you discovered it, or what you had to do to create it\nd) How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience\ni) Faster, easier or less effort/sacrifice (value equation)\n4. Provide some proof (this can be a stat, a past client, or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable\n5. Paint a vivid mental image of what their life will be like assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits\n6. Always ascribe a price tag to them and justify it\n7. Tools & checklists are better than additional trainings (as the effort & time are lower with the former, so the value is higher. The value equation still reigns supreme).\n8. They should each address a specific concern/obstacle in the prospects mind about why they can't or won't be successful (bonus should prove their belief incorrect)\n9. This can also be what they would logically realize they will need next. You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it.\n10. The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also, subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses right? (No, but you can use this psychological bias to make your offer seem wildly compelling).\n11. You can further enhance the value of your bonuses by adding scarcity and urgency to the bonus themselves (which takes this technique and puts it on steroids).\na) Bonuses With Scarcity\nVersion 1: Only people who sign up for XZY program will have access to my Bonus #1, 2, 3 that are never for sale or available anywhere else other than through this program.\nVersion 2: I have 3 tickets left to my $5,000 virtual event, if you buy this program you can get one of the last 3 tickets as a bonus.\nb) Bonuses With Urgency\nVersion 1: If you buy today, I will add in XYZ bonus that normally costs $1,000, for free. And I'll do that because I want to reward action takers.\nc) With hope, you can see the subtle differences. The first two examples aren't constrained by time. They state that if you buy the program you will get things you normally would not be able to. The bonus with urgency is about them buying today, and if they do not buy today, they lose those bonuses.

This is free marketing for them, and high value products for you at no cost. Businesses will do this because you are going to give their business exposure for free to the highest quality prospects, your customers. As long as they are not direct competitors, you can get some brownie points, secure some future referral IOUs, and make your offer more valuable at the same time. If you secure enough of these relationships, you can literally justify your entire price in the savings and additional true-to-price bonuses.\nFor example - if I owned a pain clinic, I might get a massage therapist to give me 1-2 free massages to incorporate into my offer. On top of that, I might get:\n...a chiropractor to give me two free adjustments. (Value: $100)\n...a low inflammation food company to give me discounts for their products ($50 savings)\n...discounts for braces and orthotics ($150 savings)\n...a local health club down the street to give me a personal training session for free and a free month of membership to their pool ($100 Value)\n...discounts on pharmaceutical drugs from the local pharmacist ($100/mo in savings)\n...repeat the above for multiple service providers (so perhaps I get ten chiropractors to all give me a free adjustment, now I have ten free adjustments in my bundle.\n...Etc\nNow if my offer was $400, then the value of these free bonuses ALONE is worth more than the $400.\nAs if that weren't already awesome enough, if you really want to be a jedi, negotiate a group discount and a commission to yourself. This is exactly what we did with our supplement company. Our gym owner clients who use our sister supplement company Prestige Labs sponsored athletes get a 30% discount on our products, on top of that, the sponsored athlete gets paid 40% of all sales netted after the applied discount.\nSo it's a win-win for everyone. Their clients get it for 30% less than our main site. They get paid for giving away exclusive discounts. And we get customers in exchange for the commission paid. Everyone wins.\nIf you are following along, each of these bonuses can become revenue streams for you indirectly by getting clients to say YES more easily, and directly because you can negotiate that each of these businesses can pay you for the people you send their way.\nSo let's also say we negotiated the following \"affiliate commissions\" for making the introduction to these businesses.\n...the chiro gives you $100 per person who comes into their office\n...the food company gives you free food (yum!)\n...orthotics company gives you $100 per person referred\n...health club gives you a free membership OR $50 per person who signs up\n...pharmacy gives you $100 per person\nNow let's look at how much money we made...our $400 offer now has the possibility of making us an extra $350...pure profit! That's the beauty of these relationships. The other businesses will pay you and you don't have to do anything but refer customers to them that you have already spent the money to acquire.\nAnd if you really want to get crazy, come up with a grand slam offer with these partner businesses by using the same concepts in the book so that each of the bonuses themselves becomes even more valuable than a simple commoditized service.",

You can get people to act faster. You can price anchor and product anchor (little known). You can get more people to say yes than you otherwise would. If you want to a live deep dive with me on this, go to Acquisition.com/training/offers and select \"Bonus Creation\" to watch a short video tutorial. I also have a Free Bonus Checklist I use when creating offers. Swipe it for your own business on the house!\nSummary\nWe want to employ bonuses because they expand the price to value discrepancy and get people to purchase who otherwise wouldn't. They massively increase the prospects' perception of the value of our offer. So here's what to do:\n1. Create checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, and anything else that would take lots of time and effort to create on one's own, but is easy to use once created. Anything that you can invest in one time that clearly cost time or money to create, but can be given away endless time is a perfect fit for a bonus.\n2. Beyond that, make a habit to record every workshop, every webinar, every event, every interview and use them as additional bonuses (as needed to crush a perceived obstacle).\n3. Proactively negotiate group discounts and a referral commission with adjacent businesses that solve needs your customer will have as a result of beginning this process with you. What's the next natural thing they might want? Go to those businesses, get a deal for them they could never get for themselves (because you are negotiating with the purchasing power of all your customers at once, very powerful).\nAuthor Note: The longer you are in business the more of these bonus assets you will have at your disposal. All of these things are valuable. Put them in a vault and keep them in your back pocket to sprinkle into an offer to get the deal closed. Information products work very well here because they have high perceived value, low cost, and zero operational effort besides giving an additional login. Tickets to virtual experiences or events work too. Same goes for a higher level of service that has a fixed cost like giving someone VIP service for a month (which also doubles as a way of upselling them into that level of service to keep them on it . . . more on that in Book II.)\nWhat should be a bonus vs part of the core offer if I am the one fulfilling it?\nShort answer: Wow Factor - in other words - something you wouldn't want someone to miss. Many times you have so much \"stuff\" you will be providing your customers (good thing) that valuable nuggets can get lost in the mix. You want to take the most distinct ones that can almost stand on their own and pull those out to highlight them. This is especially true for things that are short in length but high in quality or value. Checklists or infographics can condense a lot of information into a small space. Someone might not feel justified paying lots of money for a product launch map (for example) but as a bonus would be perceived as very valuable.\nNext Up . . .\nWe have our core offer. We are presenting it in a way to increase scarcity and urgency to increase the likelihood they want it even more. We stacked the bonuses of our offer to make the price to value discrepancy out of this world and break our prospects' minds. Next on our magical journey will be addressing the big elephant in the room...risk. We will completely obliterate it using a combination of guarantees so they have no reason not to buy.",

          "text": "ENHANCING THE OFFER: GUARANTEES\n\"You're gonna like the way you look...I guarantee it.\"\nMEN'S WAREHOUSE AD THAT RAN FOREVER.\nThe single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is...drum roll...risk. Risk that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do for them. Therefore, reversing risk is an immediate way to make any offer more attractive. You will want to spend a disproportionate amount of time figuring out how you want to reverse it. That being said, how much more attractive can a guarantee make an offer?\nJason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer 2-4x simply by changing the quality of the guarantee. It's that important.\nFrom an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees: 1. Unconditional 2. Conditional 3. Anti-Guarantee 4. Implied Guarantees.\nYou must always hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why.\nBut won't people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?\nSometimes, but not usually. That being said, you must understand the math. If you close 130 percent as many people, and your refund percentage doubles from 5 percent to 10 percent, you've still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that all goes to the bottom line.\nEx: 100 sales, 5 refunds (5%) = 95 Net Sales\nGuarantee Offer 130 sales, 13 refunds (10%)= 117 Net sales\n117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)\nDon't be emotional, just do the math. For a guarantee to not be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be 100 percent offset by people who refunded. So an absolute increase in sales of 5 percent would need to be offset by an absolute increase in refunds of 5 percent (but that might be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely). So, for the most part, the stronger the guarantee, the higher the net increase in total purchases, even if the refund rate increases alongside it.\nWarning: While guarantees can be effective sellers, people who buy because of guarantees can become very shitty customers. A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to see success with your product or service. In a world where you want to reverse risk and get customers the best outcome possible, tying your guarantee to the things they need to do to be successful can help all parties.\nPro Tip: High Cost Services Warning\nIf you have a tremendous amount of cost associated with your product or service, you will likely want to employ a conditional guarantee or an ANTI guarantee, as you will have to eat the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling.",

          "text": "From an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees: 1. Unconditional 2. Conditional 3. Anti-Guarantee 4. Implied Guarantees.\nTypes of Guarantees\nWhat makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z.\nTo give a guarantee teeth you have to decide what you'll do if they don't get the result.\nWithout the \"or what\" portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted.\nNote: This is what most marketers do.\nBad Example: We will get you 20 clients guaranteed.\nBetter example: You will get 20 clients in your first 30 days, or we give you your money back + your advertising dollars spent with us. This is a simple, but strong guarantee.\nHere are the four types of guarantees. I'll go over them in theory then we will apply them.\n1) Unconditional Guarantees\nAs I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional, and \"anti-\" guarantees. Unconditional are the strongest guarantees. They're basically a trial where they pay first then see if they like it. This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you will have some people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.\n2) Conditional Guarantees\nConditional guarantees include \"terms and conditions\" to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on. In general, you want these to be \"better than money back\" guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you want to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment. These also can have a very powerful effect on getting clients results. If you know the key actions someone must take in order to be successful, make those part of the conditional guarantee. In a perfect world, 100% of your customers would qualify for a conditional guarantee, but will have achieved their result, and therefore will not want to take it. That is an ideal we can all aspire towards. And just fyi - if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised the vast majority of people will take the outcome.\n3) Anti-Guarantees\nAnti-guarantees are when you explicitly state \"all sales are final.\" You will want to own this position. You must come up with a creative \"reason why\" the sales are final. Typically, you'll want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your part that a consumer could immediately understand and think \"Yes, that makes sense.\" These types of guarantees are especially important with items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given.\n4) Implied Guarantees\nImplied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare, profitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etc are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I don't get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of \"If I do a great job, I will be very well compensated.\" These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that you will get compensated when you do perform.\nStacking Guarantees\nAn experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees. For example, you could give an unconditional 30 day no questions asked guarantee then on top of that give a conditional triple your money back 90 day guarantee. That would be an example of stacking an unconditional with a conditional guarantee.\nYou can also stack two conditional guarantees around different (or sequential) outcomes. For example, you'll make $10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do thing 1, 2, and 3. This future paces the prospect into an outcome they now believe is far more likely (since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for achievement). Doing this shows the prospect you are serious about getting them results and convinced that they will achieve what they want. This shifts the burden of risk back from them onto us...a very powerful strategy.",

It's also very risky. You put yourself in a situation where if someone does not achieve the results, whether because of your fault or not, you will still be held accountable. Obviously this is a strong, but unoriginal guarantee. You can add conditions, but the more conditions you add, the faster this guarantee loses its teeth.\nWording: I heard Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, pitch his unconditional guarantee on a webinar and I thought it was unbelievable. These are 100% his words and not my own. I take no credit for this but have included it for completeness.\n\"I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision, that is all. The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. So you get on the inside and see if everything we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you. Then, if it is, that's when you decide to keep it. If it's not for you, no hard feelings. You will then, after signing up at URL be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn't for you. But you can't make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it. And know this...whether it's 29 min or 29 days from now...if you ain't happy, I ain't happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you want your money back you can get it because I only want to keep your money if you're happy. All you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell use \"gimme my money\" and you got it, and in short order - our response times to any support request average 61min over a 24/7 time period. You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you have is the real deal and I'm fairly confident that when you sign up at URL you're getting exactly what you need to BENEFIT.\"\nPro Tip: Name Your Guarantee Something Cool\nIf you are going to give a guarantee, spice it up. Instead of using \"satisfaction\" or some other \"vanilla\" word, describe it more strongly.\nGeneric Example (Bad): 30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee.\nCreative Imagery Example #1 (Good): In 30 days, if you wouldn't jump into shark infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar you paid.\nCreative Imagery Example #2 (Great): You'll get our famous \"Club a Baby Seal Guarantee\"After 30 days of using our services, if you wouldn't club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don't have to pay a penny.\n[Unconditional] Satisfaction-Based Refund Guarantee (Expanded from above):\nWhat the Client Gets: If at any time they're not satisfied with the level of service they're receiving from you, they can request a refund (at any time) for the program.\nMy Take: Believe it or not, this was my guarantee when I sold weight-loss programs. Besides being an irresistible offer, I guaranteed satisfaction. I used the strength of my guarantee to close a lot of deals. \"Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm not guaranteeing you're going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I'll write you a check the day you tell me we suck.\"\nIt works perfectly with a best-case/worst-case close. \"Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today.\" If you are good at what you do, you can use a guarantee like this to push a lot of people over the edge. That line made me a lot of money. I had two people take me up on it out of 4,000 sales in three and a half years.\nSatisfaction/No questions asked is the highest form of guarantee. It means we could do everything right and you could still ask for your money back. As long as you know the math, you will typically make up for the refunds in spaces with higher and faster closing on the sales side. But you have to be good at fulfilling your promises. If not, steer clear. I believe this offer works much better in lower-ticket situations. It becomes very risky as you go into higher-ticket services with higher costs of fulfillment.\nPro Tip: Unconditional vs Conditional Based on Business Type\nBigger broader guarantees work better with lower ticket B2C businesses (many people just won't bother taking the time). The higher the ticket, and the more business oriented it is, the more you want to steer towards specific guarantees. That may or may not include refunds, and may or may not have conditions.",

And this is a guarantee to add with a consumption condition. That means they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee. A world class affiliate marketer Jason Fladlien (who did $27M in a single day) recently used an amazing guarantee for a course he sold. He said \"if you buy this course and spend $X on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000 no questions asked.\" He claimed that an additional $3M in sales came from this crazy guarantee on a $2997 course. What's more, he only gave 10 of these $25,000 refunds out. So the refund generated $2.75M in extra sales. That's what a crazy guarantee does for you.\nIn general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales. This really serves the purpose when you need a lot of stuff to be done by your prospect, and, assuming those things are done, there's a low chance of the result not being achieved. Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top. This guarantee will typically outperform a traditional 30-day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions (sales minus refunds).\n[Conditional] Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You keep working for them free of charge until X is achieved.\nMy Take: This is probably my personal favorite guarantee of all time. It essentially guarantees they will achieve their goal, but it eliminates the element of time. You are never at risk for losing the money. The guarantee is around the outcome. To add further flavor to it, you can make this guarantee conditional on them doing key actions linked with success: setting up a web page, attending calls, showing up to workouts, weighing in, reporting data, etc.\nReal Talk: Since I have been advising businesses to use this particular guarantee, I have yet to have a single person say a client took them up on it. Realistically, if someone actually does everything you asked them to do and doesn't achieve the result by the time you had said, one of two things usually happens:\n1. Seeing your client's commitment, you happily keep working with them until they achieve the desired result\n2. It gets dropped. Your client is likely very close to the goal, which means satisfied.\nAlso, it's likely the sales conversation with the guarantee was months earlier. What may have been important in the sales conversation is a distant memory now, replaced by their affection towards you/your business.\n[Conditional] Modified Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You give them another Y-long period of service or access to your product/services free of charge. Generally, Y should give them at least twice the duration.\nMy Take: This is like the service guarantee, but it ties a specific duration to your extended work/involvement. So instead of being on the hook \"forever,\" you're only on the hook for an additional Y period of time. I've seen it work magically and keep the business on the hook for a more finite period of time which may be an easier place for you to start before doing the \"all out\" Service Guarantee above.\n[Conditional] Credit-based Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You give them back what they paid but in a credit toward any service you offer.\nMy Take: This is best used during an upsell process to seal the deal on a service they are unsure they will like. They already like what they have, you are trying to sell them more of that. Worst case, they can apply it to the thing they already like. So it maintains goodwill with the customer.\n[Conditional] Personal Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You work with them one-on-one, free of charge, until they reach X objective or result.\nMy Take: This is absolutely one of the strongest guarantees in existence. It's like a service guarantee on crack. You will definitely want to add conditions, though: they must respond back in twenty-four hours, they must use the products you tell them to, they must XYZ. Only if they do that, will you keep working with them one-on-one.\nThis is especially powerful as you scale and become more edified as a business owner. Can you imagine one of my sales people saying, \"Alex will personally work with you until your offer converts\"? Right. It would work. It would also be a nightmare. So I would probably put contingencies like, \"Provided you've already spent $10,000 on your existing offer using our structure, the offer you ran was for lead generation, and it was a free offer. These are things that would make it unlikely they would not succeed. If for some reason they hadn't with those stipulations in place, I could probably fix their problem in ten minutes just looking at it.",

I just love it a lot for workshops and in-person experiences. Normally the event would cost more than the hotel and airfare, so it's like adding an extra $1000 to a guarantee but way more tangible. It's original enough that people like it.\n[Conditional] Wage-Payment Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You offer to pay their hourly rate, whatever that may be, if they don't find your call/session with them valuable.\nMy Take: This is also an ancillary cost guarantee, just a very original one. If someone ever actually asks for the wage payment, just ask them for their tax return and divide it by 1,960 (number of working hours at 40hrs/wk for a year). But no one asking for a refund will actually do that, so you will never actually have to give one of these out. Like ever.\n[Conditional] Release of Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You let them out of their contract free of charge.\nMy Take: This voids a commitment or cancellation fee. If you have a business that has enforceable commitments, contracts or clauses, this can be a powerful guarantee. Better yet, if you are in a business that does not enforce your contracts, then you have nothing to lose by adding the guarantee.\n[Conditional] Delayed Second Payment Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You won't bill them again until after they make or get their first outcome. Ex: Lose your first five pounds . . . make your first sale . . . get your website live, etc.\nMy Take: I like this a lot, especially if you have a very systematized process for getting the first result. It gets the prospect thinking in fast action terms and gets them moving. It will also focus your team on activating your client. This is a great one when you know what metric or action drives activation (predicting indicator of long term retention) of a client.\nI've successfully used this guarantee loads of times.\n[Conditional] First Outcome Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You continue to pay their ancillary costs (ad spend, hotel, etc) until they reach their first outcome. Example: If you don't make your first sale in 14 days, we will pay for your ad spend until you do.\nMy Take: Just like the delayed second payment, just centered around a different cost. I personally like this setup a lot. It keeps everyone focused on getting that first dollar over the bridge. Once that one comes across, the second comes soon after.",

Once that one comes across, the second comes soon after.\n[Anti-Guarantee] All Sales Are Final\nWhat the Client Gets: Access to super exclusive very valuable service/product. Likely, this is a very powerful thing that once seen cannot be unseen, or once used cannot be taken away. Example: a line of code to improve your checkout experience on a website. Once someone received this code, they could try and use it without paying you. Or a series of opening messages for picking up girls, or opening sentences for messaging cold prospects. Things that are very valuable but incredibly easy to steal after they've been seen/understood.\nMy Take: This can enhance the persuasiveness of the sale and the value of the product or service. It essentially implies that the client is going to use it and see an immense benefit thereby exposing the business to vulnerability. It acts as a damaging admission. We have an \"all sales are final\" policy, but that is because our product is so exclusive and so powerful that once used it cannot be unused.\" Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is attention-worthy.\nSo instead of being wishy-washy, lean into the fact this thing works so well, and is so easy to copy, you must make all sales final. They'll believe you even more if you take this position. \"We are going to show you our proprietary process that we are using right now to generate leads in our business. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We're going to be exposing the inner workings of our business, as a result, all sales are final.\" Note: strong reason why is needed here. Just make one up that sounds compelling. The more you can show real exposure, the more effective this will be.\nAnti-guarantees can also work very well with high ticket products and services that require a lot of work or customization. \"If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you are not the type of person we want to work with. We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and are not looking for a way out before they even begin. If you are not serious, don't buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing. \" From these examples, you should get the idea.\nImplied Guarantees: Performance Models, Revshares, and Profit-Sharing\nPerformance: A) ...Only pay me $XXX per sale/ $XXX per show B) $XX per Lb Lost\nRevshare: A) 10% of top line revenue B) 20% profit share C) 25% of revenue growth from baseline\nProfit-Share: A) X% of profit B) X% of Gross Profit\nRatchets: 10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% if over Z\nBonuses/Triggers: I get X when Y occurs.\nWhat The Client Gets: If you do not perform, they do not have to pay. If you perform, your compensation has been determined based on an agreement decided upon before you begin working.\nMy Take: Performance, Revshare, and Profit-shares aren't guarantees \"per se\", but for all intents and purposes, they are. There is an implied guarantee whenever you enter into a revshare or performance partnership: if you dont make money, you don't have to pay me. In my opinion, this is one of, if not THE most desirable setup. First because it makes you accountable to your clients' results. Second it weeds out low performers. Perfect alignment between client and service provider fosters collaboration and a long-term relationship. I'm a big fan. The drawbacks are tracking and collection. So if you can find a way around that...you've hit a gold mine. This is a part of the offer we teach our agencies who use our software. We help them switch from a retainer model to a performance model and wrap that into the Grand Slam Offer I walked through earlier. I've seen countless agencies go from $20k/mo to $200k+/mo in a matter of a few months.\nYou can also pair a revshare or performance setup with a minimum. It would be like saying \"we get the greater of $1000 or 10% of revenue generated.\" So if the client doesn't generate money because of whatever reason this at least covers your costs of services etc.\nOr saying we get $1000/mo for the first 3 months, then after that, it switches to 100% performance. This would be ideal for a setup that takes a lot of time to get going.\nThese types of offers work well when you have quantifiable outcomes. The stronger, of course, is no guaranteed payment without performance.",

The stronger, of course, is no guaranteed payment without performance.\nCreate Your Own Winning Guarantee\nReversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer. Experienced marketers spend as much time crafting their guarantees as the deliverables themselves. It's that important.\nI have personally used all the guarantees listed above (except for the hotel and phone call one, which I just saw and liked). But you can come up with your own! The key is to identify a client's biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. \"What do they not want to have happen if they pay you? What are they most afraid of?\" Reverse their fears into a guarantee. Think of the time, emotion, and outside costs associated with any program or service. The more specific and creative the guarantee is, the better.\nThat being said, guarantees are enhancers. They can enhance the magnetism or attraction of any offer, but they cannot make a business. If a guarantee is used to cover up a poor sales team or a poor product, it will backfire into lots of refunds. No bueno.\nMy advice: Start selling service-based guarantees or setting up performance partnerships. This will make all sales final (so no fear from refunds). Most importantly, it will commit you to your customers' results and keep you honest. From there, either keep that guarantee and scale (perfectly fine), or move up the food chain to less restrictive guarantees to increase volume.\nWe now have a core offer built and guarantees chosen.\nNext Up...\nNow all we have to do is put a bow on this puppy and actually name it. Naming an offer correctly determines how well your advertising converts, how big of a response you get from outbound emails/cold calls/texts, and how many inbound responses you get from organic comments.\nIt matters.\nThat being said, I will show you how to generate unlimited names or \"wrapping paper\" for your offer. That way it never fatigues, no matter how small your market may be. This is the key to evergreen lead generation.\nFree Gift # 9 BONUS: Create A Winning Guarantee With Me\nGuarantees can make or break businesses.

After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit.\"\nCHARLIE MUNGER, VICE CHAIRMAN BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY\nMarch 2017.\nMy heart was racing. I could literally feel each beat pounding in my chest. I clenched my jaw to fend off the knot in my throat that I knew would lead to tears. I wanted to give in. Years of emotions were bottled below the surface.\nYears of ignoring my reality and lack of success. Years of putting off how I felt just focusing on moving forward. The pressure was shooting to the surface. I could feel it.\n\"We did it,\" I said.\nLeila, my wife now, looked up at me. She was in the kitchen making dinner and stopped, spatula in hand. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"We did it. We hit $100k.\" I could barely get the words out because I didn't want the tears to break through the tremble in my voice.\n\"Like revenue?\"\n\"No. Like in our personal bank accounts.\"\n\"Holy shit really?! That's amazing!!\"\nShe ran over to me, disregarding the food on the stove, and wrapped her arms around my neck, spatula still in hand.\n\"I'm so proud of you\"\nShe squeezed me. I slumped into her arms. It was like every knot in my body that I had been holding onto melted all at once. I could barely contain myself. But when I think back to it, the feeling I had wasn't happiness. It was relief. I'd moved from fear to security. I'd traded feeling like a failure everyday, watching my work and effort yield nothing, to realizing a dream. The constant anxiety and fear of \"what are we gonna do\" finally be replaced by something else. I finally had time to let myself feel something.\nI felt like this \"struggle\" chapter of life was finally over.\n\"Look,\" I said. \"It's for real\"\nI nuzzled my head out of Leila's arms. I didn't want to look her in the eyes because I knew it would put me over the edge. I pulled my phone out and put it between us. We both stared at the unmoving screen with our personal bank account balance.\n$101,018\nOur gazes remained unbroken as they confirmed a new, shared reality. It wasn't an illusion. It wasn't revenue. It wasn't \"profit\" that was still in the business account, only to be taken out later by some unforeseen emergency. It wasn't \"earmarked\" money that had to be used to pay off some debt. It was ours. For real.\n\"Babe,\" I said. \"We could fuck up and not make another dollar for three straight years, and still be okay.\"\nAt the time, $33,000 per year was more than enough for us to live at our current expenses for three years and some.\nYears of ups and downs. Years of ploughing money into my business(es) only to watch it vanish in overhead, payroll, and mistakes. Years of seminars, courses, workshops, coaching programs, masterminds . . . had F-I-N-A-L-L-Y turned into wealth.\nIt felt like I had broken into a new plane. The relative increase in wealth was more than I ever felt.\nTens of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was, and still is, the richest I have ever felt in my life. It was the beginning of the next chapter in my life as a business person and entrepreneur.\nSome people get there fast. Some people get there slowly.

To advance, I find that we must determine which skills, beliefs, and character traits we lack. Most times, we simply need to improve. And the only way to do that is through learning from experience and/or high quality sources. I have received terrible advice from people who were ahead of me at the time. And though experience is the best teacher, she is not the kindest.\nIt is my most sincere hope that what I produce provides the guidance I so desperately needed when I was coming up on my entrepreneurial journey. And I wish I could cover it all in a single book (for my sake and yours). But, to do you the service I wish I had had, I cannot. The devil is in the details. Excellence exists in the depth of knowledge and nuances. That's what separates the greats from everyone else. I hope that in all the content I produce you see my dedication to this detail and nuance that makes all the difference. These lessons were hard won.\nI hope you've enjoyed this first volume in my offers series. Before we move forward into volume two, where we'll be focusing on lead generation, as mentioned above, I wanted to circle back to where we started. After reading this book, I hope:\n1. You're well on the path to creating your first Grand Slam Offer. Or at the very least, can take components that you were missing in your offer to make it more compelling to your market.\n2. I've delivered on my promise from the beginning of this book: that investing two to three hours of your time here would yield you a far higher return than just about anything else you could do.\n3. I hope in return I've taken one small step towards earning the thing I value most from you -- your trust.\nFinally, I hope this book creates a small dent in improving the world because I believe no one is coming to save us. It's up to us, as entrepreneurs, to innovate our way into a better world. And that's something I'm willing to devote my life to. And I hope you are, too.\nI'm grateful for your attention. You could have given it to anything, and you chose to invest it with me. I take it in high regard. So, sincerely, thank you.\nStay hungry,\nAlex",

If you like listening, I have a Podcast called \"The Game\" where you can tune in to short episodes that deliver tactical lessons (learned from failures) so you can get to your goals faster. Check the podcast out here: alexspodcast.com\nYOUTUBE. I have a Youtube channel with fresh tutorials a few times a week: just search my name \"Alex Hormozi\" to find it.\nIG. You can follow me on IG if you like the more personalstuff: @hormoz",
