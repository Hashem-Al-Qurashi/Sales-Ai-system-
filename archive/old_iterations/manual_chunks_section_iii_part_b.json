I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.\nConvergent & Divergent Thinking\nIn simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math.\nExample:\nYou have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.\nIt takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).\nYou need to get to 110 sales . . .\nHow many sales people must you hire?\nDeduced Information:\n1 salesperson = 100 calls\n4 calls = 1 close\n100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls\n25 closes per rep\nGoal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4\nSince you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.\nANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.\nMath problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it's easy to grade.\nBut life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking, you can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others. Cool right?\nHere's what life presents us for divergent thinking: Multiple Variables, Known & Unknown, Dynamic Conditions, Multiple Answers.\nAs such, I want to do an exercise with you that will engage the part of your brain that you will need to use in order to make something magical.\nI call it the \"brick\" exercise. Don't worry, it'll only take 120 seconds.\nThe Brick Exercise\nRight now, I want you to set a timer on your phone for 120 seconds. What you need to do: Think of a brick.\nWrite down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of. How many different ways could a brick be used in life to provide value.\nReady? Go. It's okay to write in the book.\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\n________________________________________\nAlright — stop. Now before I show you my list, did you consider the following . . .\n. . . How big is the brick? A tab of gum, 3-5/8\" x 2-1/4\" x 8\" (Standard), 2 ft x 2 ft x 6ft?\n. . . What is the brick made of? Plastic, Gold, Clay, Wood, Metal?\n. . . How is the brick shaped? Does it have holes in it? Does it have divots for interlocking?\nNow as you think about that, can you think of even more uses for the brick than you probably wrote down?\nHere's my list:\nPaper weight\nDoor stop\nBuilding things\nHome for a fish in a fish bowl\nPlant holder with dirt in the holes (holed brick)\nAs a trophy (painted brick)\nRustic decoration\nTo break window\nMake a mural (tiny bricks painted)\nA weight for resistance training\nA wedge under uneven platform\nPen holder (holed brick)\nChildren's toy (lego bricks)\nFloatation device (plastic brick)\nPayment for goods (gold brick)\nStabilizer for leaning something against\nRetainer of value (gold brick)\nHolder for flagpole (holed brick)\nA seat (jumbo brick)\nEvery offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible. Our goal is to use a divergent thought process to think of as many easy ways to combine these elements to provide value.\nSo if I were selling a brick, I would find out what my customer's desire was, and then devise how many ways I could create value with my \"brick.\"\nNow let's do it for real.",

      "content": "Now let's do it for real.\n9\nW\nVALUE OFFER: CREATING YOUR GRAND SLAM OFFER PART I: PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS\n\"ABC, Easy as 123 Ah, simple as doh reh mi\"\nMICHAEL JACKSON, \"ABC\"\nhen I started my gym, I struggled. I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start my own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something. But try as I did, I couldn't even sell people into a $99/mo bootcamp. People would say, \"LA Fitness is $29/mo. This is expensive.\" I even tried getting people to start for free. They said they wouldn't bother because $99/mo afterwards was still too much, and they didn't want to start something they wouldn't continue with.\nIt's a new level of frustration when you can't even give your services away for free to people. I felt worthless, and I didn't know what to do. Thankfully, during this time, I was in groups with other gym owners, and I started hearing about marketers and books. I devoured everything I could. And as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy's books, I was hooked.\nIn his books, he talked about making \"irresistible offers.\" Again, this theme of \"making an offer so good people would feel stupid to say no\" kept re-appearing. But this time, remembering what TJ had told me, I decided to go all in on this concept, rather than just do what everyone else was doing.\nBut how? Everyone else was selling $99/mo bootcamps. How was I going to compete? So I decided to look at what we did differently. I thought — what do they really want? No one wants a membership; they want to lose weight.\n\nStep #1: Identify Dream Outcome\nI had heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there.\nLose 20lbs in 6 weeks.\nBig dream outcome - lose 20lbs.\nWith a decreased time delay - 6 weeks.\nNote: I wasn't selling my membership anymore. I wasn't selling the plane flight. I was selling the vacation. When you are thinking about your dream outcome, it has to be them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience.\n\nStep #2: List Problems\nNext, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the \"next\" thing they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you'll continually be answering people's next problem as it manifests..\nSo, let's go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect's perspective as you think about them. What points of friction exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane detail (the more problems the better!).\n\nExample Problem List: Weight Loss\nFirst thing they must do: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping\n1. Buying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won't like it\n2. Buying healthy food will take too much time\n3. Buying healthy food is expensive\n4. I will not be able to cook healthy food forever. My family's needs will get in my way. If I travel I won't know what to get.\n\nNext thing they must do: Cooking healthy food\n1. Cooking healthy food is hard and confusing. I won't like it, and I will suck at it.\n2. Cooking healthy food will take too much time\n3. Cooking healthy food is expensive. It's not worth it.\n4. I will not be able to buy healthy food forever. My family's needs will get in my way. If I travel I won't know how to cook healthy.\n\nNext thing they must do: Eating healthy food\n1) Etc...\n\nNext thing they must do: Exercise Regularly\n1) Etc...\n\nNow we're gonna go full circle here. Each of the above problems has four negative elements. And you guessed it, each aligns with the four value drivers as well.\n1. Dream Outcome→ This will not be financially worth it\n2. Likelihood of Achievement→ It won't work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way. (This is the most unique and service-specific of the problem buckets).\n3. Effort & Sacrifice→ This will be too hard, confusing. I won't like it. I will suck at it.\n4. Time→ This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It will take too long to work. It won't be convenient for me.\n\nNow, go ahead and list out all the problems your prospect has. Don't let these buckets, which are just meant to get your brain going, constrain you. If it's easier for you, just list out everything you can possibly think of.\nWhat I showed here isn't just four problems, though. We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath. So 32 to 64 problems total. Yowza. No wonder most people don't achieve their goals. Do not get overwhelmed. This is the best news ever. The more problems you think of, the more problems you get to solve.\nSo, to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do. Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it, or keep doing it (using the four value drivers as a guide).\nNow we get to the fun part: turning problems into solutions.\n\nStep #3: Solutions List\nNow that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone's way, it's time to define our solutions and list them out.\nCreating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions. That's it. So let's take a look at our list of problems from earlier. What we're going to do is simply turn them into solutions by thinking, \"What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?\" Then we are going to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution-oriented language. This is copywriting 101. It's beyond the scope of this book to get into, but simply adding \"how to\" then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great place to start. For our purposes, we are giving ourselves a checklist of exactly what we are going to have to do for our prospects and what we are going to solve for them.\nOnce we have our list of solutions, we will operationalize how we are actually going to solve these problems (create value) in the next step. And I want to be 100 percent clear. You will solve every problem. We'll explore how together, in the next step.\n\nPROBLEM→ SOLUTION\nPROBLEM: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping\n. . . is hard, confusing, I won't like it. I will suck at it→ How to make buying healthy food easy and enjoyable, so that anyone can do it (especially busy moms!)\n. . . takes too much time→ How to buy healthy food quickly\n. . . is expensive→ How to buy healthy food for less than your current grocery bill\n. . . is unsustainable→ How to make buying healthy food take less effort than buying unhealthy food\n. . . is not my priority. My family's needs will get in my way→ How to buy healthy food for you and your family at the same time\n. . . is undoable if I travel; I won't know what to get→ How to get healthy food when traveling\n\nPROBLEM: Cooking healthy food\n. . . is hard, confusing. I won't like it, and I will suck at it→ How anyone can enjoy cooking healthy meals easily\n. . . will take too much time→ How to cook meals in under 5 minutes\n. . . is expensive, it's not worth it→ How eating healthy is actually cheaper than unhealthy food\n. . . is unsustainable → How to make eating healthy last forever\n. . . is not my priority, my family's needs will get in my way→ How to cook this despite your families concerns\n. . . is undoable if I travel I won't know how to cook healthy→ How to travel and still cook healthy\n\nPROBLEM: Eating healthy food\n. . . is hard, confusing, and I won't like it→ How to eat delicious healthy food, without following complicated systems\n. . . etc\n\nPROBLEM: Exercise Regularly\n. . . is hard, confusing, and I won't like it, and I will suck at it → Easy to follow exercise system that everyone enjoys\n….etc.\n\nOkay, whew. That's a lot of problems (and a lot of intuited solutions courtesy of divergent thinking). You'll also notice that a lot of them are repetitive. That's totally normal. The value drivers are the four core reasons. Our problems always relate to those drivers, and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase. What's even crazier: is that if only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy. You would be amazed at the reasons people do not buy. So don't limit yourself here.\nBrooke Castillo is a friend who runs an enormous life coaching business. To give you a different take on the problems-solutions list, Brooke sent me her list as she was going through this book to make a Grand Slam Offer for a 90-Day Relationship course. Take a look to see this process through a totally different lens. The main takeaway, though: Don't be fancy. Just get all the problems down then turn them into solutions.\nRegardless of whether the offer you're creating is around fitness (like the example), a relationship course (like Brooke), or something wildly different (like ear aches), we now know what we need to do. Step four is the how (and how to do it without breaking the bank).\nFREE GIFT #5 Bonus Tutorial: Offer Creation Part 1\nIf you want to walk through the process with me live, go to Acquisition.com/training/offers then select \"Offer Creation Part 1\" to watch a short video tutorial.
