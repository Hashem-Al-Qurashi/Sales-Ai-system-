  "text": "Virtuous Cycle of Price\n\nI have used this framework in most of the materials I release because it needs to be consistently reinforced. The forces of the marketplace will grate on your belief system. You must stay strong and ignore them! Here's the basic premise of why you need to charge a premium if you want to best serve your customers.\n\nWhen you decrease your price, you . . .\n. . . Decrease your clients' emotional investment since it didn't cost them much\n. . . Decrease your clients' perceived value of your service since it can't be that good if it's so cheap, or priced the same as everyone else\n. . . Decrease your clients results because they do not value your service and are not invested\n. . . Attract the worst clients who are never satisfied until your service is free\n. . . Destroy any margin you have left to be able to actually provide an exceptional experience, hire the best people, invest in your people, pamper your clients, invest in growth, invest in more locations or more scale, and everything else that you had hoped in the goal of helping more people solve whatever problem it is that you solve.\n\nIn essence, your world sucks. And to make matters worse, your service probably sucks because you are squeezing blood from the proverbial stone. There's just not enough money left over to make something exceptional. As a result, you fall in line with the armies of average businesses that race to the bottom. I've lived that life. It's terrible. If you love your customers and your employees, please stop short-changing them when there is a better way.\n\nHere's the reverse. This is what happens when you raise your prices.\n\nWhen you raise your prices, you . . .\n. . . Increase your clients' emotional investment\n. . . Increase your clients' perceived value of your service\n. . . Increase your clients' results because they value your service and are invested\n. . . Attract the best clients who are the easiest to satisfy and actually cost less to fulfill, and who are the most likely to actually receive and perceive the most relative value\n. . . Multiply your margin because you have money to invest in systems to create efficiency; smart people; improved customer experience; scale your business; and, most importantly of all, to keep watching the number in your personal bank account go up, month after month, even with reinvesting in your business. This allows you to ultimately enjoy the process for the long haul and help more people as you grow, rather than burning out and shriveling into obscurity.\n\nTo swing the argument even further in favor of higher prices, here are a few interesting concepts. When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product. Wait, what? Yes.\n\nHigher Price Means Higher Value (Literally)\n\nIn a blind taste test, researchers asked consumers to rate three wines: a low-priced wine, a medium-priced wine and an expensive wine. Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible. They rated them, unsurprisingly, in order of their price, with the most expensive being the \"best,\" the second most expensive being \"second best,\" and the third, cheapest option, being rated as \"cheap wine.\"\n\nWhat the tasters didn't know is that the researchers gave them the exact same wine all three times. Yet, the tasters reported a wide discrepancy between the \"high priced\" wine and the \"cheap\" wine. This has deep implications for the direct relationship between value and price.\n\nIn essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What's more, the higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn't just to be slightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, \"This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.\"\n\nThat is how you create a category of one. In this new perceived marketplace, you are a monopoly and can make monopoly profits. That is the point.\n\nOne final point I want to drive home: if you offer a service where a customer must do something in order to achieve the result, or solve the problem you say you solve, they must be invested. The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve the positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else. This is how you win.\n\nBut I know this isn't easy, and it shouldn't be. Your product must deliver. So many wish to shortcut the real work. Do that and you will fail. In the real world, to have the \"gonads\" to charge big ticket prices, you must outwork your self doubt. You must be so confident in your delivery, because you have done it so many times, that you know that this person will succeed. Experience is what gives you the conviction to ask for someone's entire year's salary as payment. You must believe so deeply in your solution that when you look at yourself in the mirror at night, alone, your conviction remains unshakable. So let me bring this section home with my personal experience.\n\nMy Premium Price Experience\n\nIn my first niche consulting business — Gym Launch — I teach gym owners a better business model. Before productizing my consulting services, I flew out to 33 gyms in 18 months to do full turnarounds.\n\nWe would fly out, fix everything in the gym, and relaunch it in 21 days. We would average an increase in $42,000 in additional sales in 21 days. It was wild. My fee was the 100% of the revenue I would bring in.\n\nAt our peak, we were turning around eight gyms a month. This quickly became a logistical nightmare. After the wear and tear of living in motels month after month after month, I thought to myself there has to be a better way to do this.\n\nOne month, there was a gym we were scheduled to go fly out to. But, I simply didn't want to do it. So I told them we were going to cancel the engagement. The gym owner practically threatened me to help him. So I said I would help him, but he would have to do all the work, but I would show him how.\n\nWithin thirty days, this gym had made almost $44,000 in new up front cash collected sales (4x their previous month). As soon as I saw that my process could be duplicated from afar, without me having to fly people in. . .our business exploded. I had found the missing link because my travel schedule was no longer a constraint. We went on to sell 4000+ more gyms over the next few years (and counting) using a done-with-you rather than a done-for-you model. But. . .back to premium pricing.\n\nWhen I entered the space, low-price competitors offered full-service marketing for $500 per month, with a single high-price competitor charging $5,000 for his product.\n\nI wanted to be the premium price leader. I wanted to be so expensive that it created allure around what we were doing. So, we came in at three-times the highest-priced player and 32 times more than the lower-priced players. A price of $16,000 for a 16-week, done-with-you intensive. Then we upsold 35 percent of those people into a three-year, $42,000/year agreement for us to help them grow their gyms.\n\nFor context: The average gym owner makes $35,280/year in take-home profits. If that's the average, it means half make even less than that. So for many of them, they were committing to half of their yearly pay or more to buy our program. And I was selling this to grown men as a kid in his twenties, telling them I was going to help them make more money. This was possible because my conviction was stronger than their skepticism. How?\n\nBased a voluntary survey taken at our last full company event, with 158 gyms responding, we found that a Gym Launch gym who has been in our program for 11 months will experience the following average improvements:\n\nTop Line Revenue Growth: +$19,932/mo (+$239,000/yr)\nRecurring Revenue Growth: +$13,339/mo (+$160,068/yr)\nBottom Line Growth (Profit): From $2,943/mo to $8,940/mo (3.1x!)\nClient Growth: +67\nChurn (% of clients who leave each month): From 10.7 percent to 6.8 percent\nRetail Sales: +$4,400/mo in retail product sales revenue\nPrices: From $129/mo to $167/mo\n\nThe survey just proved what I already knew. I had complete conviction in our product.\n\nI knew it worked. I had outworked my self-doubt.\n\nSummary Points\n\nWhat should you take from this?\n\nFirst and foremost, charge a premium. It will allow you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful. We were able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry. In a real way, we were charging on a fraction of what our clients made using our system. This is important. Our clients still got a deal. The gap between what they paid (price) and what they got (value) was massive. As a result, the virtuous cycle continued to spin. We charged the most money. We provided the most value.\n\nOur gyms remained the most competitive, made the most money, always had the latest and best acquisition systems, and had the support to implement them at lightning speed.\n\nWe made many mistakes along the way, but our pricing model was not one of them. It allowed me the room to make big bets without losing the farm. The truth is that 99 percent of businesses need to raise their prices to grow, not lower them. Profit is oxygen. It fuels the fire of growth. You need it if you want to reach more people and make a bigger impact.\n\nIn order to charge so much, though, you must learn to create tremendous value.
