  "text": "FREE GOODWILL\n\n\"He who said money can't buy happiness, hasn't given enough away.\"\nUNKNOWN\n\nPeople who help others (with zero expectation) experience higher levels of fulfillment, live longer, and make more money.\n\nI'd like to create the opportunity to deliver this value to you during your reading or listening experience. In order to do so, I have a simple question for you...\n\nWould you help someone you've never met, if it didn't cost you money, but you never got credit for it?\n\nIf so, I have an 'ask' to make on behalf of someone you do not know. And likely, never will.\n\nThey are just like you, or like you were a few years ago: less experienced, full of desire to help the world, seeking information but unsure where to look….this is where you come in.\n\nThe only way for us at acquisition.com to accomplish our mission of helping entrepreneurs is, first, by reaching them. And most people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover (and it's reviews). If you have found this book valuable thus far, would you please take a brief moment right now and leave an honest review of the book and its contents? It will cost you zero dollars and less than 60 seconds.\n\nYour review will help….\n….one more entrepreneur support his or her family.\n….one more employee find work they find meaningful.\n….one more client experience a transformation they otherwise would never have encountered.\n….one more life change for the better.\n\nTo make that happen...all you have to do is….and this takes less than 60 seconds….leave a review.\n\nIf you are on audible - hit the three dots in the top right of your device, click rate & review, then leave a few sentences about the book with a star rating.\n\nIf you are reading on kindle or an e-reader - you can scroll to the bottom of the book, then swipe up and it will automatically prompt a review.\n\nIf for some reason they have changed either functionality - you can go to the book page on amazon (or wherever you purchased this) and leave a review right on the page.\n\nPS - If you feel good about helping a faceless entrepreneur, you are my kind of people. I'm that much more excited to help you crush it in the coming chapters (you'll love the tactics I'm about to go over).\n\nPPS - Life hack: if you introduce something valuable to someone, they associate that value with you. If you'd like goodwill directly from another entrepreneur - send this book their way.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.\n- Your biggest fan, Alex\n\nVALUE OFFER: THE THOUGHT PROCESS\n\n\"If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again.\"\nTHOMAS H. PALMER, TEACHER'S MANUAL\n\nI want to do an exercise with you right now. I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.\n\nConvergent & Divergent Thinking\n\nIn simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math.\n\nExample:\nYou have 3 salespeople who can each take 100 calls per month each.\nIt takes 4 calls to create one sale (including no shows).\nYou need to get to 110 sales . . .\nHow many sales people must you hire?\n\nDeduced Information:\n1 salesperson = 100 calls\n4 calls = 1 close\n100 calls/4 calls per close = 25 Closes Per 100 Calls\n25 closes per rep\nGoal: 110 sales total / 25 sales per rep = 4.4\nSince you can't hire 4.4 reps, you decide you must have five.\nANSWER: And since you have 3, you hire two more.\n\nMath problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it's easy to grade.\n\nBut life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking, you can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others. Cool right?\n\nHere's what life presents us for divergent thinking: Multiple Variables, Known & Unknown, Dynamic Conditions, Multiple Answers.\n\nAs such, I want to do an exercise with you that will engage the part of your brain that you will need to use in order to make something magical.\n\nI call it the \"brick\" exercise. Don't worry, it'll only take 120 seconds.\n\nThe Brick Exercise\n\nRight now, I want you to set a timer on your phone for 120 seconds. What you need to do: Think of a brick.\n\nWrite down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of. How many different ways could a brick be used in life to provide value.\n\nReady? Go.\n\n[Exercise space omitted for brevity]\n\nAlright — stop. Now before I show you my list, did you consider the following . . .\n. . . How big is the brick? A tab of gum, 3-5/8\" x 2-1/4\" x 8\" (Standard), 2 ft x 2 ft x 6ft?\n. . . What is the brick made of? Plastic, Gold, Clay, Wood, Metal?\n. . . How is the brick shaped? Does it have holes in it? Does it have divots for interlocking?\n\nNow as you think about that, can you think of even more uses for the brick than you probably wrote down?\n\nHere's my list:\nPaper weight\nDoor stop\nBuilding things\nHome for a fish in a fish bowl\nPlant holder with dirt in the holes (holed brick)\nAs a trophy (painted brick)\nRustic decoration\nTo break window\nMake a mural (tiny bricks painted)\nA weight for resistance training\nA wedge under uneven platform\nPen holder (holed brick)\nChildren's toy (lego bricks)\nFloatation device (plastic brick)\nPayment for goods (gold brick)\nStabilizer for leaning something against\nRetainer of value (gold brick)\nHolder for flagpole (holed brick)",
