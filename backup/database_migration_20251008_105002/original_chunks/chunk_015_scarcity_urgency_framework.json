  "text": "ENHANCING THE OFFER: SCARCITY\n\n\"Sold out.\"\n\nScarcity is one of the most powerful and least understood forces to unlock unlimited pricing power. If you want to learn how to sell air for millions of dollars, then pay attention.\n\nThe reason an authority (like a doctor), a celebrity (like Oprah), or a celebrity authority (like Dr.Oz or Dr.Phil) can charge egregious rates is because of implied demand. People assume that there is a lot of demand for their time, and, therefore, not a big supply of it. As a result, it must be expensive.\n\nThat being said, it's hard for most businesses to understand what it's really like to have an uneven supply-demand curve until you've experienced it. I'm going to try and walk you through what it felt like for me the first time I experienced it in order to give you a taste of the power.\n\nWhen I got into this world of acquisition, I saw mentors of mine selling days of time for $50,000+. My mind was blown for two reasons. First, because I didn't understand how they could make so much money for a single day. Second, because I didn't understand who in their right mind was buying it. Over time, I learned.\n\nI'll start with the buyer. If I have a rare problem, and I must solve this problem for my own pursuit of happiness, it will consume all of my attention. By the nature of my problem being specialized, there will be very few people who can solve it. This means there is not a large supply of solvers. In many cases, I will perceive only one possible \"solver\" (Supply = 1).\n\nReal Life Value Case Study\nThere are many people who can solve the problem: how do I make $10,000 per month?\nBut far fewer who can solve: How can I add $5M in profit without adding any extra product lines to my business? (This was a real project that took me 60min and resulted in exactly $5M in bottom line profit by slightly altering the pricing model of the business). You could say the business owner was… \"very happy\" with the result of the engagement.\n\nBeyond that, if solving this problem speeds up my achievement of a goal by a year or two, or immediately results in me making hundreds of thousands of dollars, or millions of dollars, that solution becomes far more valuable, does it not? Of course it does. And so, it would follow, if I can pay someone $50,000 for a day of their time, and see an increase of $500,000 per month in revenue within three months because of the insights and strategies revealed, that would be a helluva return on investment, right?\n\nSo there are two components to the value: first, how rare the sources are; second, the actual value being provided. The value and rarity compound to create some truly breathtaking profits.\n\nSpecialized consultants are paid millions of dollars to solve problems worth tens of millions to clients. The client pays for all the experience and expertise the expert has and avoids the cost of errors (time and money). In short, they skip the bad stuff and go straight to the good stuff more quickly and for less money than it would cost to figure it out on their own . . . a beautiful economic exchange.\n\nI personally experienced this for the first time when I had two different people offer me $50,000 for a day of my time after speaking at an event. They were scaling an education business in a niche (not too dissimilar from my own) and could not get past the $1M per month mark. As someone who was doing $1M per week in the same business type (at the time), I was a very specific type of person with the keys to their problem.\n\nSo what happened, you ask? Drum roll . . . I didn't accept their offers. Why? Because I was making more than $50,000 per day in profit from my business and didn't want the distraction.\n\nAuthor Note:\nIt was years later that I started Acquisition.com to help these very people. But instead of charging a day rate, I simply become an equity holder in the company to completely align interests for short and long term (and so I can see the implementations through). And as my time is limited by the laws of physics, for everyone else below that $3M-$10M per year mark, I make all these materials for free :)\n\nAfter the event concluded and I was speaking with Leila, I realized how I had somehow become 'one of those people I had always wondered about'. It was a very surreal experience for me. I finally understood how premium prices were truly made . . . simple supply and demand. There is little that substitutes for incredible demand. You can try and fake it, but there is a special type of \"0 fucks given\" vibe that's hard to replicate when you truly do not need a person's money (or even want it).\n\nThat's how these guys can charge so much . . . because they don't need it. The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand. I always try to remember that. It's one of the negotiating and pricing principles that has best served me in my life.\n\n\"But Alex, how are you going to show me how to use scarcity to increase the amount of people who want my offer when currently no one does?\" Great question. Let's attack some real-world, in-the-trenches strategies to reliably create scarcity .\n\nCreating Scarcity\n\nWhen there's a fixed supply or quantity of products or services that are available for purchase it creates \"scarcity\" or a \"fear of missing out.\" It increases the need to take action, and by extension, purchase your offer. This is where you publicly share that you are only giving away X amount of products or can only handle Y new clients.\n\nFor example, if a musician drops a limited edition hoodie and says he only made 100 and they will never be made again, are you more or less likely to buy it than one that is always available? More likely, naturally. The idea that you can never get it again makes it more desirable.\n\nThis is an example of scarcity. It is the fear of missing out on something. It pulls on our psychological fear of loss to get us to take action. Humans are far more motivated to take action to hoard a scarce resource than they are to act on something that could help them. Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain. We will wield this psychological lever to get your clients to buy in a frenzy, all at once, until you are sold out.\n\nThree Types of Scarcity\n1. Limited Supply of Seats/Slots: in general or over X period of time.\n2. Limited Supply of Bonuses\n3. Never available again.\n\nBut how do you use this properly without being phony? I'll try and give you some real world examples\n\nPhysical Products\n\nHaving limited releases is a tried and true method of using this psychological bias to your advantage. You can have limited releases for flavors, colors, designs, sizes, etc. \"This month, we are releasing 100 boxes of mint chocolate cookie flavored protein bars.\" Important point: to properly utilize this method you should always sell out.\n\nHere's why: it's better to sell out consistently than over order and fail at creating that scarcity. This method stacks in effectiveness if it is done repeatedly over time (just not too often). Once a month seems to be the sweet spot for most of the companies that I know who do this with regularity.\n\nSecond Important Note: When using this tactic, you must also let everyone know that you sold out. That is part of what makes it work so well. This way, even people who were on the fence, when they see that it was sold out, it gives social proof that other people thought it was worth it. And now that the choice has been made for them, they desire it more because there is no way they can get it. So the next time you make the offer they will be far more likely to take you up on it.\n\nFun fact: Chanel, a brand that has maintained insane margins and pricing for over a century, is a master of scarcity. They send only 1-2 of each piece to each store so every store has a different selection and every item is the last or second to last item in stock. This allows them to price far above market and turn buying impulses into purchases.\n\nServices\n\nWith services, especially if you want to consistently get customers, it can be a little trickier to use scarcity. But I will show you a few simple ways to employ scarcity ethically to increase your take rates on offers. These all have similar elements with very slight tweaks. I'm enumerating these because one of these might mentally fit your business model more than others.\n\n1. Total Business Cap - Only accepting….X Clients. Only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going). This puts a cap on how many clients you service but also keeps them in it. You create a waiting list for new prospects. The moment the door opens, they jump right in and price resistance disappears. Periodically, you can increase capacity by 10-20% then cap it again. This works well for your highest tiers or service levels.\n\na) This is like saying \"My agency only will service twenty-five customers total. Period.\" Over time you can increase your prices and squeeze the lower performing accounts out and bring in new more profitable accounts, or, you can periodically 'open slots' as your capacity allows (always leaving some demand unmet).\n\n2. Growth Rate Cap - Only accepting X clients per week (on-going) \"We only accept 5 new clients per week and we already have the first 3 spots taken. I have 6 more calls this week, so you can take the spot or one of my next calls and you can wait until we reopen.\" I have used this method since the beginning of my business. I always knew what my capacity was per week, and simply chose to let our prospects know how many openings we had left. This banks on the fact that you can only handle a certain amount of new clients anyways, on a regular basis, so you might as well let them know it.\n\n3. Cohort Cap - Only accepting….X clients per class or cohort. Similar to the above, except done on whatever cadence you desire. Only accepting X amount per class or cohort over a given period is another way of thinking about it. Imagine you only start clients monthly or quarterly. This helps you get some cadences in place in your business operationally while also allowing your sales team some legitimate scarcity. Example: \"We take on 100 clients 4 times a year. We open the doors then close them.\" Etc.\n\nPro Tip - Provide Limited Access For Higher Ticket Services\nThese scarcity tactics work especially well for higher ticket upsells. If you want to create one off workshops, trainings, events, seminars, consulting, etc. These are things that by their nature take time and provide more access. Paring them with clear scarcity or fixed amounts, seats, or spots will rapidly drive up the demand. But always remember have less spots available than you think you can sell . . . so that when you want to do it again in the future, everyone will remember you sold out . . . fast. This is a compounding strategy that increases in effectiveness over time. One of the few in the marketing arsenal.\n\nLet me give you a real example of scarcity to enhance the value of a free lead magnet. If I were to tell you right now that I have a checklist that you can download for free that has all these materials for you in this book in bulleted format, you might be inclined to put this book down and go there to download it now.\n\nBut, if I told you I have it set so that every week the page only allows twenty new people to download it, you'd be far more likely to go see if you can grab it. And even more so if when you try it, you see that it has already run out for the week. Result? You join a list that notifies you the next time twenty more checklists become available for download. What happens next? When you get that notification, you'll hit the link on your phone and go to the page because you don't want to miss out again.\n\nBy employing scarcity, we make what would otherwise be a \"neat free download\" into a desirable thing not everyone has access to. You also, by extension, would be far more likely to consume it when you do get your hands on it . . . all because of how we controlled supply. Cool, right?\n\nHonest Scarcity (The Most Ethical Scarcity)\n\nThe easiest scarcity strategy is honesty. Wait, what? Let me explain.\n\nI'm sure right now, you probably couldn't handle 1,000 clients tomorrow right? But how many could you handle? 5? 10? 25? Well, you might as well define a number that you are willing to take on in a given time period, then advertise that. Simply letting people know that you are three-fourths of the way to capacity this week will move people over the edge to buying from you. Or letting people know that you are 81% to capacity in your total business, will make people more likely to sign up with you \"before they lose the chance.\" Scarcity also implies within it, social proof. If you are 81% to capacity then a decent amount of people made the decision to work with you, and the closer you get to your arbitrary fullness, the faster the spots will disappear. But only you get to draw where that line is \"full.\" Neat right?\n\nSummary Points\n\nEmploy one or multiple methods of scarcity in your business. You will drive a faster purchasing decision from your prospects, and at higher prices. Just let them know your limits and let psychology do the rest.\n\nNow that we've covered some of my favorite scarcity tactics that you can use year round, what else could you do to increase demand without changing anything about your offer? Increase urgency. We will cover that next.\n\nPro Tip - Extreme Scarcity\nIf you don't hate money, sell a very limited supply of 1-on-1 access. You can do that via any of the mediums described in \"Delivery Cube.\" Direct message access. Email Access. Phone access. Voice memo access. Zoom access. Etc. There are lots of ways you can do this. But I promise you this - if you want to immediately make a lot of money, create a very exclusive service level based on access to you (yes, unscalable), that you cap at a tiny number. Price it very high. Then, tell people. You will make more money than you thought possible. These also tend to be some of the best clients. And limit your delivery to something that you don't hate. For me, I hate emails and messages but dont mind zoom calls. Make it work for your working style. The cream of the crop (the 1% of 1% will adjust and take action).\n\nPro Tip - Once You're Out, You Can Never Come Back\nYou can create scarcity by also capping your service level and saying that if they leave than can never return. This type of scarcity makes people think extra hard about leaving. I started doing this with my gyms early on. Then I was in a mastermind that employed this. Then I started using it in my higher level of Gym Lords. This works best with small groups (like the above example). As groups become much bigger, the tactic loses some teeth (speaking from experience).\n\nENHANCING THE OFFER: URGENCY\n\n\"Deadlines. Drive. Decisions.\"\nME\n\nScarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time.\n\nThis is where you only limit when people can sign up, rather than how many. Having a defined deadline or cut off for a purchase or action to occur creates urgency. Frequently, scarcity and urgency are used together, but I will separate them out for you to illustrate the concepts.\n\nI'm going to show you my four favorite ways of using urgency on a consistent basis, ethically: 1) Rolling Cohorts, 2) Rolling Seasonal Urgency, and 3) Promotional or Pricing Urgency 4) Exploding Opportunity. They will employ urgency in your business without being phony. My favorite way of doing this is having cohorts of clients start on a regular cadence. This has the added operational benefit of helping you create a choreographed onboarding experience for new clients. As you scale, this will become increasingly important.\n\n1) Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency\n\nFor example, if you start clients every week (even in unlimited amounts), you can say:\n\n\"If you sign up today, I can get you in with our next group that kicks off on Monday, otherwise you'll have to wait until our next kickoff date.\"\n\nIf you wanted to juice it up a little bit, you could say:\n\n\"I actually had a client who signed up a few weeks ago drop out, so I have an opening for our next cohort that kicks off on Monday. If you are pretty sure you're gonna do this sooner or later, might as well get in on it now so you can start reaping the rewards sooner rather than paying the same and waiting.\"\n\nThose two tweaks above have pushed so many sales over the edge by just reminding a potential customer that if they sign up, they will be starting on Monday, and if they do not, they will have to wait a week. It's small things like this that nudge people to take the action they know they should take anyways.\n\nObviously the less frequently you kick off new customers, the more powerful this is. For example, if you only start clients two times a year, people will be very inclined to sign up, especially as the date approaches. Even starting new clients every other week can confer this urgency nudge.\n\nWhat if I lose sales by turning business away?\nJust like guarantees, there is always a fear that you will make less money by employing this strategy. We are afraid that we will lose sales we would have otherwise made. Every experienced marketer on the planet will tell you - it is a fear, and it is unfounded. The biggest sales on a week long campaign or launch happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60%). That means that the last 3% of the time allotted creates 50-60% of the sales...that's completely illogical, but also unmistakably human. So, just like a guarantee, you will make more money from the many people who decided to take action than people who actually missed out because in reality, those people were never going to buy (heck, they didn't even buy when they had their fee to the fire, so why would they without?) Good to remember.\n\nWhat to do if you just started a cohort and someone wants to buy….\nYou have two options: 1) you can offer them a speedy personalized onboarding to get them up to speed as a \"bonus\" for signing up today and still get them in. Or, my preference, 2) You can explain to them that since the next group starts in a little, they will have the advantage of having more time to review the materials, talk to their employees (for b2b products) or family members ( for b2c products). On top of that, they can have a more extended payment plan that you can only make available to them since the start date is so far out . . . an advantage that most clients do not get. In the end, remember, you always have the advantage because you are the one who calls the shots.\n\n2) Rolling Seasonal Urgency\n\nIn a digital setting, having actual sign up date countdowns is very useful. But make sure they are real. If they aren't, you'll lose credibility and just look like every other wannabe marketer. This is very common with internet businesses that use \"launch\" models. I personally love having the dates that I am running a promotion through on my landing pages and in my copy. I want it to be visible everywhere. The nice thing is that you can always fire up another ad campaign and a new landing page with new dates and be right as rain. You will see your conversions go through the roof, and it takes maybe five minutes of editing — well worth the time investment.\n\nExample: Our New Year Promotion ends Jan 30!\nNext Month: Our Valentines Lovers Promo Ends Feb 30!\nNext Month: Our Sexy By Spring Special Ends March 31!\nNext Month: Our Fools in Love April Promo Ends April 30!\n\nThe actual promotion may be the same, but naming it something different \"by season\" gives you a \"real\" differentiator that gives you a start and a finish. Deadlines drive decisions. By simply having these, you can point to them and let human beings push themselves over the edge so as not to miss out.\n\nPro Tip - Local Businesses: This is my number one strategy for local businesses. They must vary their marketing more frequently than national advertisers. Putting a new wrapper with a date on the same core service gives you urgency and novelty that will consistently outperform the \"same old\" campaigns.\n\n3) Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency\n\nThis is another way of creating urgency using your actual offer or promotion/pricing structure as the thing they could miss out on (kind of brilliant!). It allows businesses that sell clients year round to still use urgency. For example, \"Yes, let's get you started today so you can take advantage of the discount you came in for. I'm not sure how long we will be running it as we change them every 4 weeks or so, and this is one of the better ones we have run in a while.\"\n\nThis creates some fear of missing out on the promotion (or discount or bonuses), rather than your actual service. It would be a lie to say that if you own a roofing business you won't service them if they buy after the date. But, if you talk specifically about the promotion you can often elicit the same urgency on buying in the prospect while maintaining your integrity — winwin. You can interchange a pricing promotion, discount, or added bonuses like free install or free onboarding or an extra workshop (valued at $1,000) if they buy now. These are all things you can swap around your core offer to create urgency.\n\nPro Tip - Clean Your Pipeline With Every Price Change: If you ever really are planning on raising your prices (hopefully soon if you are reading this book!) then you can always clean out your pipeline by letting people know \"The price is going up! So get in now!\" Never raise your prices without letting people know. It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from the people in the pipeline who were on the fence.\n\n4) Exploding Opportunity\n\nOn occasion you will be exposing the prospect to an arbitrage opportunity. The opportunity itself has a ticking time clock, as all great opportunities do. Every second someone delays, they miss out on disproportionate gains.\n\nExample: If I was explaining an arbitrage opportunity between buying products on ebay and selling them on amazon, this market inefficiency would over time correct itself. The sooner someone acts the better it will be for them. This could be true for selling someone on the opportunity of trading crypto currencies, buying a stock, getting into a new platform to advertise before competitors jump on the bandwagon. Highly competitive job environments often get job offers that are \"exploding offers\" everyday they wait to take the job, their pay or bonuses decrease. This forces prospects to make fast decisions rather than try and \"wait it out\" to see if they get a better offer.\n\nAll of these examples show opportunities that decay with time, so if you find yourself in front of an opportunity like this, make sure to emphasize it!\n\nSummary Points\n\nAdding a deadline and incorporating one or multiple forms of urgency will get more people to take action than would otherwise. I have employed all four of these methods with great effectiveness. I suggest you do the same.
