  "text": "Final Thoughts\n\nEntrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits. To advance, I find that we must determine which skills, beliefs, and character traits we lack. Most times, we simply need to improve. And the only way to do that is through learning from experience and/or high quality sources. I have received terrible advice from people who were ahead of me at the time. And though experience is the best teacher, she is not the kindest.\n\nIt is my most sincere hope that what I produce provides the guidance I so desperately needed when I was coming up on my entrepreneurial journey. And I wish I could cover it all in a single book (for my sake and yours). But, to do you the service I wish I had had, I cannot. The devil is in the details. Excellence exists in the depth of knowledge and nuances. That's what separates the greats from everyone else. I hope that in all the content I produce you see my dedication to this detail and nuance that makes all the difference. These lessons were hard won.\n\nI hope you've enjoyed this first volume in my offers series. Before we move forward into volume two, where we'll be focusing on lead generation, as mentioned above, I wanted to circle back to where we started. After reading this book, I hope:\n\n1. You're well on the path to creating your first Grand Slam Offer. Or at the very least, can take components that you were missing in your offer to make it more compelling to your market.\n\n2. I've delivered on my promise from the beginning of this book: that investing two to three hours of your time here would yield you a far higher return than just about anything else you could do.\n\n3. I hope in return I've taken one small step towards earning the thing I value most from you -- your trust.\n\nFinally, I hope this book creates a small dent in improving the world because I believe no one is coming to save us. It's up to us, as entrepreneurs, to innovate our way into a better world. And that's something I'm willing to devote my life to. And I hope you are, too.\n\nI'm grateful for your attention. You could have given it to anything, and you chose to invest it with me. I take it in high regard. So, sincerely, thank you.\n\nStay hungry,\nAlex\n\nPS - (see golden ticket below)\n\nGOLDEN TICKET: ADMIT ONE\n\nIf you're doing $3M to $50M per year and you'd like my help 1-on-1 scaling your business go to Acquisition.com. Specifically, we help service, education, training, consulting, brick and mortar, or niche licensing companies scale so profitably they only have to get rich once. I'm not the \"make your first dollar\" person, I'm the \"make the last dollar you'll ever need to make\" person. If that sounds like you, you're savvy enough to figure out how to get ahold of me on my site & book a call. Would love to meet you and hear about your business and see if we can help.\n\nWould you be opposed to growing faster? If not...\n\nNEXT BOOK. You can check out my next book aptly named Acquisition.com Volume II Lead Generation. Which coversâ€¦.lead generation. You'll never run out of new customers if you follow the steps in that book (especially now armed with the offer we have built). Not sure if that's the final name (it's still in edits), but if you search for my name, you'll find it. You'll also likely be able to find it on my site Acquisition.com (hopefully).\n\nAUDIOBOOK. If you like listening and having all your books with you to reference (that's what I do) you can grab the audible & kindle version of any or all my books on amazon. I like reading and listening at the same time to increase my absorption & consumption speeds. Just search for the book titles and they'll both come up.\n\nPODCAST. If you like listening, I have a Podcast called \"The Game\" where you can tune in to short episodes that deliver tactical lessons (learned from failures) so you can get to your goals faster. Check the podcast out here: alexspodcast.com\n\nYOUTUBE. I have a Youtube channel with fresh tutorials a few times a week: just search my name \"Alex Hormozi\" to find it.\n\nIG.
