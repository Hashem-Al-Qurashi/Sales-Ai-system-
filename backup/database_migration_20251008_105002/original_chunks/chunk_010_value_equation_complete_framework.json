  "text": "VALUE OFFER: THE VALUE EQUATION\n\n\"We question all of our beliefs, except for the ones we really believe in, and those we never think to question.\"\nORSON SCOTT CARD\n\nI want to be abundantly clear: the goal should be to charge as much money for your products or services as humanly possible. I'm talking heinous amounts of money. That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can charge these rates and get people to say yes.\n\nFrom this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about \"what's fair.\" Every enormous company in the world charges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except they don't mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they don't mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king's ransom for your eyeballs, and it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You need to have a big discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.\n\nMany entrepreneurs believe that charging \"too much\" is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a hundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the prospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.\n\nFor example, one of my private clients (whose company I have equity in) is in the photography space. Over two years, implementing the tactics outlined in this book, the owner was able to increase the average ticket from $300 to $1,500. That's a 5x increase (gasp). Even cooler, they now spend less time per customer, and have higher customer satisfaction. The 5x increase in average ticket, 38x'd the profit of the business. It went from making $1,000/wk in profit to $38,000/wk in profit, and continues to grow. As a result, the company was finally able to continue to scale to multiple locations and provide meaningful work to great employees. And a fun benefit, we were able to donate even more money to children's charities which is something the owner and I have in common (almost $500,000 at the time of this writing). But none of that would have been possible without figuring out what people valued most, tripling down on it, and ruthlessly eliminating everything else. A 5x price increase may seem crazy to you, but clients voted with their dollars that what the company provides now is far better than what it did before. Cracking value opens up the world of unlimited profit, impact and possibilities.\n\nThose who understand value are the ones who will be able to charge the most money for their services. The good news is that there is a repeatable formula that I have created (I've never seen it displayed elsewhere) to help quantify the variables that create value for any offer. I call it The Value Equation. Once you see it, you can never unsee it. It will operate in your subconscious, running in the background, calling out to you. It's a new lens through which to see the world.\n\nThe Value Equation\n\nValue = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)\n\nAs you can see from the equation, there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease.\n\n1. (Yay) The Dream Outcome (Goal: Increase)\n2. (Yay) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal: Increase)\n3. (Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement (Goal: Decrease)\n4. (Boo) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice (Goal: Decrease)\n\nIf you noticed the questions in the last section that my father asked me, you'll see they corresponded with these pillars:\nWhat will I make? (Dream Outcome)\nHow will I know it's going to happen? (Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)\nHow long will it take? (Time Delay)\nWhat is expected of me? (Effort & Sacrifice)\n\nGet The Bottom To Zero\n\nIn the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement (social proof, third-party edification, etc). In other words, the top side of the equation. That's where beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims. It's easy, and it's lazy.\n\nBut as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice.\n\nThe best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate, seamless, and effortless. Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time. Amazon made purchasing a single click of a button and made purchases arrive almost immediately (maybe by the time you read this, they'll be sending drones to our doors within 60 minutes). Netflix made consuming television immediate and effortless. So, the older I get, the more I have shifted my focus to \"the hard stuff\" — decreasing the bottom side of the equation. And I believe the better you do this, the more you will be rewarded by the marketplace.\n\nFinal note: The reason this is a division equation and not an addition (\"+\") is that I wanted to convey one key point. If you can make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you're golden. No matter how small the top side is, anything divided by zero equals infinity (which is technically undefined for the math nerds). In other words, if you can reduce your prospects' true time delay to receiving value to zero (aka you realize your immediate dream outcome), and your effort and sacrifice is zero, you have an infinitely valuable product. If you accomplish this, you win the game.\n\nGiven this postulate, a prospect would (in theory) purchase something from you, and the moment their credit card was run, it would immediately become their reality. That is infinite value.\n\nImagine clicking the purchase button on a weight loss product and instantly seeing your stomach turn into a six-pack. Or imagine hiring a marketing firm, and as soon as you sign your document, your phone begins ringing with new highly qualified prospects. How valuable would these products/services be? Infinitely valuable. And that's the point.\n\nI don't know if we entrepreneurs will ever get there, but that is the hypothetical limit we all should strive towards, and why I structured the equation this way.\n\nPerception is Reality\n\nPerception is reality. It's not about how much you increase your prospect's likelihood of success, or decrease the time delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is not valuable. Many times, they will have no idea. The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice.\n\nA prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction (aka value) was never from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train was coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders' perception of time delay and sacrifice (being bored waiting) more than actually making the trains faster (which costs billions of dollars to do). Isn't that cool? This is how we need to think about our products.\n\nPro Tip: Logical vs Psychological Solutions\nMost people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions. But the logical solutions have usually been tried...because they're logical (it's what everyone would try and do).\n\nAs a business owners and entrepreneurs I increasingly approach problems to find psychological solutions, rather than logical ones. Because if there were a logical solution, it probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem. All that's left are the psychological problems.\n\nExamples inspired by Rory Sutherland, CMO of Ogilvy Advertising:\n\"Any fool can sell a product by offering it for a discount, it takes great marketing to sell the same product for a premium\"\n\nLogical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction\nPsychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map\nPsychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!)\n\nLogical solution: make elevator faster\nPsychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator\n\nLogical solution: make it cheaper\nPsychological solution: make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more.\n\nOften, most logical solutions have been tried and failed. At this point in history, we must give the psychological solutions a shot to solve problems.\n\n#1 Dream Outcome (Goal = Increase)\n\nPeople have deep, unchanging desires. This is what marriages are lost over, wars are fought over, and people will willingly die for. Our goal is not to create desire. It's simply to channel that desire through our offer and monetization vehicle.\n\nThe dream outcome is the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind. It's the gap between their current reality and their dreams. Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel understood, and explain how our vehicle will get them there.\n\nPeople generally, and our clients specifically, want:\n. . . To be perceived as beautiful\n. . . To be respected\n. . . To be perceived as powerful\n. . . To be loved\n. . . To increase their status\n\nThese are all powerful drivers.\n\nPro Tip: Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others\nWhen writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect's achievement. Connect the dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards. Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40 yards past theirs . . . they'll ask you what's changed . . . only you will know.\n\n#2 Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal = Increase)\n\nPeople pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this \"the perceived likelihood of achievement.\" In other words, \"How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?\"\n\nFor example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon's 10,000th patient versus their first? If you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient ever.\n\nPeople value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect's conviction that your offer will \"actually\" work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end.\n\n#3 Time Delay (Goal = Decrease)\n\nTime delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when they purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is.\n\nThere are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are short-term experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen \"along the way\" and provide value.\n\nPro Tip: Fast Wins\nAlways try and incorporate short-term, immediate wins for a client. Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made the right decision trusting you and your business.\n\nPro Tip: Fast Beats Free\nThe only thing that beats \"free\" is \"fast.\" People will pay for speed. Many companies have entered free spaces and done exceedingly well with a \"speed first\" strategy.\n\n#4 Effort & Sacrifice (Goal = Decrease)\n\nThis is what it \"costs\" people in ancillary costs, aka \"other costs accrued along the way.\" These can be both tangible and intangible.\n\nIn an ideal world, a prospect would want to simply \"say yes\" and have their dream outcome happen with no more effort on their behalf.\n\nThis is why \"done for you services\" are almost always more expensive than \"do-it-yourself\" because the person doesn't have all the effort and sacrifice.\n\nPutting It All Together: Meditation vs Xanax Example\n\nDream Outcome: \"Relaxation,\" \"Decreased Anxiety,\" \"Feelings of well-being\"\n\nMeditation:\n- Likelihood of Achievement: Low (requires practice)\n- Time Delay: Weeks/Months\n- Effort & Sacrifice: High (daily practice, discipline)\n- Value Score: Low\n\nXanax:\n- Likelihood of Achievement: High (guaranteed)\n- Time Delay: Minutes\n- Effort & Sacrifice: Low (take a pill)\n- Value Score: High\n\nAnd that is why Xanax is a multi-billion dollar product while I know of almost no multi-billion dollar meditation businesses . . . value.\n\nThis is also the reason that the supplement industry ($123B) is twice the size of the health club industry ($62B). They both accomplish the same perceived objectives — \"being healthy,\" \"losing weight,\" \"looking good,\" \"increased energy,\" etc. — but one is perceived as more valuable because it has lower \"costs.\"\n\nYou can either be right or you can be rich.
