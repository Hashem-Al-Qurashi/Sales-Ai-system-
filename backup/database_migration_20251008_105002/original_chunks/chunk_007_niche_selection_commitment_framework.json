  "text": "Making This Real\n\nThere are three main markets that will always exist: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. The reason that those will always exist is that there is always tremendous pain when you lack them. There is always demand for solutions to these core human pains. The goal is to find a smaller subgroup within one of those larger buckets that is growing, has the buying power, and is easy to target (the other three variables).\n\nSo if I were a relationship expert trying to find my avatar, I'd rather focus on \"second half of life relationship\" coaching for old timers than helping college students in relationships. Why? Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more pain as they are nearer their deaths (pain), have more buying power (money), and are easy to find (targeting). Lastly, at the time of this writing, there are more people turning 65 each year than turning 20 (growing).\n\nThat is the idea. Think about what you are good at in regards to health, wealth, and relationships. Then think about who might value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what you want (money), and can be found easily (targeting). As long as those three criteria are strong and the market isn't shrinking, you'll be in good shape.\n\nBut how important to your success is finding a \"great market\" versus a \"normal market\" versus a \"bad market?\" The answer: it actually depends. Let me explain.\n\nOrder of Importance: Three Levers on Success\n\nIt's unlikely you are going to be in a dying market like the newspaper example. It's also unlikely you're going to be selling toilet paper in COVID (buying frenzy). You'll likely be in a \"normal\" market. And that's totally okay. There is a fortune to be made within normal markets. My single point here is that you can't be in a \"bad\" market, or nothing will work. That being said, here's the simplest illustration of the order of importance between markets, offers, and persuasion skills:\n\nStarving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills\n\nLet's say you were to rate these elements on a scale of great, normal, and bad. You could essentially move down the line from left to right in order of importance. A \"great\" rating on a higher-order piece overpowers anything else lower on the priority scale. A \"normal\" rating moves the buck to the next part of the equation. A \"bad\" stops the equation unless a \"great\" from a higher priority component nullifies it. Here are a few examples:\n\nExample #1: Even if you have a bad offer and are bad at persuasion, you're going to make money if you're in a great market. If you're on the corner hocking hot dogs when the bars close up at 2am, with mobs of starving drunk folks, you're gonna sell out your hotdogs.\n\nExample #2 (most of us): If you are in a normal market and have a Grand Slam Offer (great), you can make tons of money even if you're bad at persuasion. This is most people reading this book. That's why I wrote it — to help you maximize your success by learning to really build a Grand Slam Offer.\n\nExample #3: Let's say you're in a normal market and have a normal offer. In order to be massively successful, you would have to be exceptionally good at persuasion. Then and only then will you succeed, with your persuasive skills serving as the fulcrum of your success. Heck, many empires have been built by exceptional persuaders. It's just the hardest path to follow and requires the most effort and learning. Nailing your offer helps you shortcut this path to success. Otherwise, you will just have a normal business that takes exceptional skill to be successful (nothing wrong with that, but probably not what you signed up for).\n\nCommit to the Niche\n\nI have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market \"Don't make me niche slap you.\"\n\nToo often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries one offer in one market, doesn't make a million dollars, then mistakenly thinks \"this is a bad market.\" Most times that's not actually the case. They just haven't found a Grand Slam Offer yet to apply to that market.\n\nThey think, I'll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors — that's it! When, in reality, both of those are normal markets and represent billions of dollars in revenue. Either would work, just not both. You must pick one. No one can serve two masters.\n\nI have coined the term \"niche slap\" to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick. All businesses and, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped.\n\nYou must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time. So, pick then commit.\n\nRiches Are In The Niches\n\nThe other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make.\n\nSimply put, niching down will make you far more money.\n\nAuthor Note - When To Broaden (Advice For Most People)\nFor most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money. After that, it will depend on how narrow the niche is, or, what is called TAM (total addressable market). A business can really only grow to meet the total addressable market. That being said, for most people, getting to $10M per year is already a top .4% achievement (only 1 in 250 businesses achieve this). So for 99.6 percent of readers below $10M per year, it's almost always easier to serve fewer clients more narrowly. But if you want to go beyond that, you may (depending on the size of your TAM) have to broaden your audience by going up market, down market, or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.\nFor context, many companies expanded to $30M+ per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If you are at $1M or $3M, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong. You just need to be better.\n\nWhen I truly grasped how much more profit I was leaving on the table, it changed my life. It was what took me from doing acquisition for anyone to teaching it to a specific avatar. In my instance, I decided on a microgym owner with ~100 members, a signed lease, at least one employee, and wanted to help clients lose weight. That's pretty specific compared to \"small business owners\" or \"anyone who will pay me\" which is common. And I was very specific. In that business (Gym Launch) - we turned down - and still do - anyone who is not that avatar. That means no personal trainers, no online coaches, etc.\n\nCould I have helped them? Of course I could have. I mean heck, the majority of our portfolio is comprised of non-gym companies. But in order to maintain product focus, and high converting messaging, knowing exactly who the product was for was a game changer.\n\nIt helped us know exactly who we were speaking to at all times. And exactly whose problems we were solving.\n\nBut simplicity and ease may not be enough to sway you, so let me illustrate why honing in on one niche will make you more money.\n\nReason: you can literally charge 100x more for the exact same product. Dan Kennedy was the first person to illustrate this for me, and I will do my best to pass on the torch to you in these pages.\n\nNiching Product Pricing Example:\n\nExample\n\nDan Kennedy taught me this (and it changed my life forever). Let's say you sold a generic course on Time Management. Unless you were some massive time management guru with a compelling or unique story, it would be unlikely it would turn into anything significant. What do you think \"yet another\" time management course is valued at? $19, $29? Sure. Nothing to write home about. Let's just say $19 for illustration sake.\n\n**Now we shall unleash the power of niche pricing in various stages on your product**\n\nSo let's imagine you make the product more specific, keeping the same principles, and call it \"Time Management For Sales Professionals.\" All of a sudden, this course is for a more specific type of person. We could tie their increase to even one more sale or one more deal and it would be worth more. But there are a lot of sales people. So this might be a $99 product. Neat, but we can do better.\n\nSo let's go down another level of niching and call our product…. \"Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps.\" Following the same principles of specificity, now we know our sales people probably have very experienced deals and commissions. A single sale would easily net this salesman $500 (or more), so it would be easy to justify a $499 price tag. This is already a 25x increase in price for almost an identical product. I could stop here, but I'm going to go one step further.\n\nLet's just niche down one last level…. \"Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps.\"\n\nBoom.\n\nThink about it for a second, if you were a power tools outbound sales rep, you would think to yourself \"This is made exactly for me\" and would happily fork over maybe $1000 to $2000 for a time management program that could help you achieve your goal.\n\nThe actual pieces of the program may be the same as the generic $19 course, but since they have been applied, and the sales messaging could speak so much to this avatar, they will find it more compelling and get more value from it in a real way.\n\nThis concept applies to anything you decide to do. You want to be 'the guy' who services 'this type of person' or solves 'this type of problem.' And even more niched 'I solve this type of problem for this specific type of person in this unique counterintuitive way that reverses their deepest fear.\"\n\nThat's why a fitness program for generic weight loss might be priced at only $19 while a fitness program designed and marketed only to shift-nurses might be priced at $1997….(even though the core of the program is likely similar - eat less, move more).\n\nEnd Result: The market matters. Your niche matters. And if you can sell the same product for 100x the price, should you?\n\nI'll let you decide.",
