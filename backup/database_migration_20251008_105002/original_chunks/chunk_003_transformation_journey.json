  "text": "30 days earlier . . .\n\nI had decided to go all in on this new business I called \"Gym Launch.\" Here was the idea: I would fly around the country to gyms and fill them up to full capacity using this new methodology that hinged on an offer I had perfected when I owned my chain of gyms.\n\nLeading up to this moment, I had sold five of my six gyms. The funds from selling them, my life's work, I had put into an account I had with a new partner. This money was supposed to be the seed money for our new company.\n\nI was finally going to realize some level of success.\n\nMy alarm went off. I groggily swung my arm over blindly clawing at the bedside table. I switched off the alarm, while Leila managed to sleep through the commotion.\n\nI laid there silently, pulling up the bank accounts ― a daily ritual. The balance said $300.\n\nWait. That couldn't be right. There was $46,000 in here yesterday.\n\nMy adrenaline surged. Looking closer I saw \"-$45,700 Payment Successful.\" I was frantic.\n\nThe money from selling all of my gyms was gone. I checked where the money went. To my \"partner.\" He had taken all the money out.\n\nFuck.\n\nThe last four years of my life had vanished that fast. I officially had nothing, and even less to show for it. No gyms. No equipment. No employees. Nothing.\n\nI felt dead inside.\n\nAdding insult to injury, in that same 30-day period, my mother was in critical condition because of a near fatal accident (and was still under 24-hour supervision), and I had totalled my car in a head on collision at 60 miles per hour and earned a DUI as my consolation prize.\n\nThis was the cherry on top. My one saving grace during this time was selling a new \"challenge offer\" at a gym and collecting all the cash up front as my \"fee\" for turning their business around.\n\nSo I did the only thing I knew. I sold. My salesman had done $120,000 in a single month, and I owed him a $22,000 commission check.\n\nThe problem was the $120,000 never came.\n\n\"We need to talk,\" I said as Leila and I went into the other room. I worked up the courage to speak but stared at the floor, embarrassed.\n\n\"I've got nothing,\" I said to her. \"I'm a sinking ship, and you don't have to stay with me.\"\n\nShe grabbed my chin and pulled my face towards hers so she could look into my eyes: \"I would sleep with you under a bridge if it came to that.\" I would have cried tears of joy, but I was so emotionally exhausted my response appeared apathetic. I wouldn't stay with me.\n\n\"Are we still gonna do these launches starting tomorrow?\" She asked. \"All my friends quit their jobs to do this.\" She was being matter of fact, but it still stung. I felt defeated. \"Listen, this could go horribly wrong,\"\n\n\"I trust you. We'll figure it out.\"\n\nI had two things left at that point: a grand slam offer and an old business credit card with a $100,000 limit from when I had my gyms.\n\nOn the day after Christmas (two days after the gut-wrenching call with the payment processor) we were scheduled to launch six new gyms . . . at the same time. Between airfare, hotels, rental cars, gas, and ad spend (all multiplied by six), I was going to be spending $3,300 per day of money I didn't have. My last dollar had gone to paying my salesman. I still remember my hand shaking as the advertisements went live: Off→ ON.\n\nJust like that, I was going into debt at a rate of $412 dollars per working hour. Just like that, $3,300 per day began getting deducted from my account.\n\n-$3,300 . . . I now officially have nothing\n-$3,300 . . . I now have officially less than nothing\n-$3,300 . . . I have $10,000 less than nothing\n-$3,300 . . . This one decision is going to ruin my future forever.\n\nBut things started shaping up. Here's what happened that month (January 2017), as documented by my old processing records I dug up. You can see the month along the left column and the revenue collected that month along the right.\n\nWe made $100,117! It was just enough to cover the $3,300/day that had been coming off the credit card. It was actually working. I could hardly believe it. I threw the hail mary, and the universe caught it. I went from looking up bankruptcy lawyers to figuring out what to do with $3,000,000 in profits, accrued within the first twelve months. It felt surreal. And in hindsight, it still kind of does.\n\nBy the end of the year we were doing $1,500,000+/mo. Twelve months from then, $4,400,000/mo. Per. Month. Twenty-four months after that, we crossed $120,000,000 in sales, donated $2,000,000 to help fund equal opportunity in low income areas. We met and befriended Arnold Schwarzenegger (lifelong hero) and were asked to be board members of his charity After School All Stars.\n\nLeila and I meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger at his home. We are now on the national board of his charity After School All Stars. Creating Grand Slam Offers has given us access to people we only dreamed of.\n\nTwelve months after that, we now have a portfolio of seven eight-figure, and multi-eight-figure companies across a variety of industries (photography, publishing, fitness, business consulting, beauty) and business types (brick & mortar chains, software, service, e-commerce, training & education). Our portfolio companies now do about $1,600,000 per week (and growing).\n\nI say this because I honestly can't believe it. All of this was because of a girl who believed in me, a credit card, and a Grand Slam Offer.",
