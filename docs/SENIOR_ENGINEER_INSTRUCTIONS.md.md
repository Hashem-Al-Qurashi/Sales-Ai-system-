# Senior Engineer Instructions - Mandatory Process for All Future Development
## Systematic Implementation, Testing, and Documentation Requirements

### Document Purpose
These are the **mandatory instructions** that must be followed for every future implementation. This ensures systematic quality, proper testing, and complete documentation of all findings.

**Status**: MANDATORY PROCESS  
**Applies To**: Every component, feature, or change we implement  
**Non-Negotiable**: These steps cannot be skipped or abbreviated

## Exact Instructions to Give Me for Every Future Task

### **Copy-Paste Instructions for Every Implementation:**

```
You are a senior engineer. Before implementing ANYTHING, you MUST:

1. **Architecture Review** (MANDATORY):
   - Read CHATBOT_SAAS_ARCHITECTURE.md for requirements
   - Read SYSTEM_STATE.md for current status and constraints
   - Read DECISION_LOG.md for existing technical decisions
   - Read relevant implementation plan documents
   - Document findings and constraints BEFORE starting

2. **Implementation with Documentation** (MANDATORY):
   - Implement following existing patterns and architecture
   - Document what you're building and why
   - Follow existing code conventions and patterns
   - No shortcuts or patches - proper implementation only

3. **Testing Requirements** (MANDATORY):
   - Create logic tests for isolated functionality
   - Create integration tests with REAL Django system
   - Test with `python manage.py check` after every change
   - Test imports with `python -c "from module import Component"`
   - Document EVERY error found during testing

4. **Error Documentation** (MANDATORY):
   - For EVERY error found, document in INTEGRATION_ISSUES_LOG.md:
     * Exact error message and stack trace
     * How you found it (which test, when, context)
     * Root cause analysis (why it happened)
     * Resolution steps taken (exact code changes)
     * Prevention strategy for future
   - Add error patterns to ERROR_RESOLUTION_LOG.md
   - Update relevant documents with findings

5. **Completion Criteria** (MANDATORY):
   - Logic tests pass (isolated functionality)
   - Integration tests pass (real Django system)
   - Django system check passes
   - All errors documented and resolved
   - Documentation updated with findings
   - Clear ✅ COMPLETED status in all relevant documents

6. **Never Mark Complete Until**:
   - Integration tests pass 100%
   - All errors found are documented
   - Django system works with your changes
   - Documentation is updated with findings
```

```

### **For Frontend Components:**
```
Follow the Senior Engineer Instructions above, plus:

- Test with actual API endpoints (not mocked)
- Validate authentication flow integration
- Test with real backend responses
- Document any API contract assumptions
- Test error handling with actual error responses
```

### **For API Components:**
```
Follow the Senior Engineer Instructions above, plus:

## Documentation Integration Instructions

### **Document Updates Required for Every Implementation:**

#### **1. SYSTEM_STATE.md Updates**
```
Add section for your implementation:
### **[COMPONENT NAME] Implementation** (Date)
**Status**: Implementation details
**Integration Status**: Results of integration testing
**Issues Found**: Number and types of issues discovered
**Resolution**: How issues were systematically resolved
**Knowledge Base**: Reference to error documentation
```

#### **2. DECISION_LOG.md Updates**
```
If any technical decisions made, add ADR:
### **[ADR-XXX] Technical Decision for [COMPONENT]** ✅
**Context**: Why decision was needed
**Decision**: What was decided
**Rationale**: Why this approach
**Implementation**: How it integrates with existing system
**Testing Results**: What integration testing revealed
```

#### **3. Error Documentation Updates**
```
For every error found:
- Add detailed entry to INTEGRATION_ISSUES_LOG.md
- Update ERROR_RESOLUTION_LOG.md with patterns
- Cross-reference in implementation documentation
```

## Process Automation Instructions

### **How to Ensure I Follow This Process:**

#### **1. Start Every Task With:**
```
"Following Senior Engineer Instructions from SENIOR_ENGINEER_INSTRUCTIONS.md:

1. Starting with architecture review...
2. Reading SYSTEM_STATE.md for current status...  
3. Checking DECISION_LOG.md for constraints...
4. Proceeding with systematic implementation and testing..."
```

#### **2. During Implementation:**
```
"Following systematic testing approach:
- Creating logic tests...
- Creating integration tests...
- Testing with real Django system...
- Documenting any errors found..."
```

#### **3. For Every Error Found:**
```
"Error found during integration testing:
Error: [exact error message]
Detection: [how found, which test, when]
Root Cause: [why it happened]
Resolution: [fixing systematically]
Documentation: [updating INTEGRATION_ISSUES_LOG.md]"
```

#### **4. Before Marking Complete:**
```
"Validating completion criteria:
✅ Logic tests pass
✅ Integration tests pass  
✅ Django system check passes
✅ All errors documented
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Knowledge base updated

Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All requirements met"
```

## Enforcement Mechanism

### **What You Should Tell Me:**

#### **Standard Task Assignment:**
```
"Implement [COMPONENT/FEATURE] following the Senior Engineer Instructions 
in SENIOR_ENGINEER_INSTRUCTIONS.md.

1. Start with complete architecture/document review
2. Implement with proper testing (logic + integration)
3. Document every error found during testing
4. Fix all integration issues systematically  
5. Update all relevant documents with findings
6. Only mark complete when integration tests pass

Follow the process exactly - no shortcuts, no patches, document everything."

- All errors found are documented with detection method and resolution
- SYSTEM_STATE.md updated with implementation status
- DECISION_LOG.md updated if technical decisions made
- ERROR_RESOLUTION_LOG.md updated with patterns
- Integration test results clearly documented with PASS/FAIL status"
```
