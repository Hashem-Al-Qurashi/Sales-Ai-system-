## Decisions

### 2025-10-04 - Documentation-First Development Approach
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: AI-assisted development tends to accumulate technical debt through patches and quick fixes without maintaining system understanding.

**Decision**: Establish four core documentation files that must be maintained:
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System design source of truth
- DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md - Senior engineering standards
- SYSTEM_STATE.md - Current implementation status
- DECISION_LOG.md - This file

**Consequences**: 
- Every change must align with documented architecture
- Increased upfront documentation overhead
- Reduced technical debt accumulation
- Better system understanding maintained over time

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Code-first with documentation later - Rejected: Leads to drift
2. Inline documentation only - Rejected: No bird's eye view
3. External wiki - Rejected: Gets out of sync

**Review Date**: 2025-11-04

### 2025-10-04 - Modular RAG Architecture
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need a scalable, maintainable architecture for the Hormozi RAG system that can evolve without major rewrites.

**Decision**: Implement a layered architecture with clear boundaries:
- API Layer (FastAPI)
- Orchestration Layer (Coordinates retrieval + generation)
- Retrieval Engine (Vector search + reranking)
- Generation Engine (LLM integration)
- Storage Layer (Vector DB + Document store + Cache)

**Consequences**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to swap components (e.g., different vector DB)
- Potential performance overhead from abstraction
- More initial setup complexity

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Monolithic single-file implementation - Rejected: Not scalable
2. Microservices architecture - Rejected: Over-engineering for current scale
3. Direct LangChain implementation - Rejected: Too opaque, hard to debug

**Review Date**: 2025-11-04

### 2025-10-04 - Chunking Strategy for 100+ Page Books
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Design optimal chunking strategy for Hormozi's books (138+ pages, 650k+ characters) while preserving business frameworks.

**Decision**: Implement Multi-Tier Adaptive Chunking with Framework Preservation

**Strategy Overview**:
1. **Framework-First Approach**: Detect and preserve complete business frameworks
2. **Hierarchical Chunking**: Chapter → Section → Paragraph levels
3. **Adaptive Sizing**: Different chunk sizes for different content types
4. **Context Enrichment**: Rich metadata and overlap management

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Tier 1**: Framework chunks (2000-3500 chars, never split)
- **Tier 2**: Chapter chunks (1500-2500 chars)
- **Tier 3**: Section chunks (1200-1800 chars)
- **Tier 4**: Paragraph chunks (500-1500 chars, fallback)

**Framework Preservation Rules**:
- **GOLD Frameworks** (never split): Value Equation, Offer Stack, Guarantee Framework
- **SILVER Frameworks** (smart split): Pricing Psychology, Scarcity/Urgency
- **Context Windows**: 200 char overlap + before/after context

**Data Pipeline**:
```
PDF → Enhanced Extractor → Framework Detector → Multi-Tier Chunker → Context Enricher → Quality Validator → Storage
```

**Expected Output**:
- ~450 total chunks from both books
- ~60 high-priority framework chunks
- 100% framework integrity preservation
- >95% context preservation quality

**Consequences**:
- **Pros**: Perfect framework preservation, optimal retrieval quality, rich context
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, higher processing time (~3min vs 30sec)
- **Trade-off**: Processing complexity for retrieval quality

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Simple fixed-size chunking** - Rejected: Would split frameworks
2. **Sentence-based chunking** - Rejected: Too granular, context loss
3. **Page-based chunking** - Rejected: Arbitrary boundaries, framework splits
4. **Token-based chunking** - Rejected: Doesn't respect semantic boundaries

**Quality Targets**:
- Framework completeness: 100%
- Context preservation: >95%
- Retrieval precision: >90%
- Processing time: <3 minutes

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Phase 1**: Enhanced extraction (2 days)
2. **Phase 2**: Framework detection (2 days)
3. **Phase 3**: Multi-tier chunking (3 days)
4. **Phase 4**: Quality validation (1 day)

**Monitoring**:
- Chunk size distribution
- Framework detection accuracy
- Context overlap quality
- Processing performance metrics

**Review Date**: 2025-11-04 (after processing first book and measuring quality)
