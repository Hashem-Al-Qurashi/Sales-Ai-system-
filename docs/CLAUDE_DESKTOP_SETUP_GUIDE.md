# Claude Desktop Setup Guide
## How to Connect Dan's Claude Desktop to the Hormozi RAG System

**Purpose**: Step-by-step instructions for Dan to configure Claude Desktop MCP integration  
**System**: Complete three-pillar Hormozi RAG system (PostgreSQL + FastAPI + MCP)  
**User**: Dan and his team (Hannah, Kathy)  
**Result**: Seamless Hormozi framework access directly in Claude Desktop conversations  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **WHAT DAN WILL GET:**

### **Before (Current State):**
```
Dan: "How do I justify higher pricing for web design?"
Claude: [Generic business advice based on training data]
```

### **After (With Our MCP Integration):**
```
Dan: "How do I justify higher pricing for web design?"
Claude: [Uses our MCP tools, calls Hormozi framework system]
Response: "Based on Hormozi's Value Equation framework:

**1. The Value Equation** (Relevance: 0.95)
*From*: Section III: Value - Create Your Offer
*Content*: Value = (Dream Outcome Ã— Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay Ã— Effort & Sacrifice)

For web design pricing justification, focus on:
- Dream Outcome: Custom, professional design vs generic templates
- Time Delay: 2-week delivery vs 6-month industry standard
- Effort & Sacrifice: Full-service approach vs client doing work themselves

*Found 3 frameworks in 340ms*"
```

**Dan gets specific Hormozi frameworks for any business question directly in Claude Desktop!**

---

## ðŸš€ **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR DAN**

### **Prerequisites (Verify These First):**

#### **1. System Services Running:**
```bash
# Dan's machine needs these services running:

# PostgreSQL database (should be running)
sudo systemctl status postgresql
# Expected: "active (running)"

# FastAPI server (start this)
cd ~/Projects/Danial\ Rag/production
source config/.env
python3 -m uvicorn api.hormozi_rag.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Expected output: "Application startup complete" + "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"
```

#### **2. Test API Working:**
```bash
# Test the API is responding (run this in another terminal):
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected: {"service": "hormozi_rag_api", "status": "healthy", ...}

# Test query endpoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "value equation", "top_k": 3}'

# Expected: JSON response with Hormozi frameworks
```

### **Step 1: Create MCP Server Configuration File**

Dan needs to create or update his Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

#### **Find Claude Desktop Config Location:**
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

#### **Add Hormozi MCP Server Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hormozi-frameworks": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/home/sakr_quraish/Projects/Danial Rag/development/mcp_server/hormozi_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "FASTAPI_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-openai-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `/home/sakr_quraish/Projects/Danial Rag/` with Dan's actual project path
- Use the actual OpenAI API key from production/config/.env

### **Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop**

After updating the configuration:
1. **Close Claude Desktop completely**
2. **Restart Claude Desktop**
3. **Check for MCP connection**: Look for "Hormozi Frameworks" tools in Claude interface

### **Step 3: Test the Integration**

#### **Test 1: Simple Framework Query**
```
Dan in Claude Desktop:
"What's the value equation?"

Expected: Claude uses search_hormozi_frameworks tool and returns 
the actual Value Equation framework from our system
```

#### **Test 2: Business Question**
```
Dan in Claude Desktop:
"I have a client who currently pays $5k for web design. 
I want to charge $10k. How do I justify this pricing?"

Expected: Claude uses our tools and returns Value Equation, 
Premium Pricing frameworks with specific guidance
```

#### **Test 3: Offer Creation**
```
Dan in Claude Desktop:
"Help me create a compelling offer for a consulting client. 
They need help with digital marketing strategy."

Expected: Claude uses our tools to get offer creation frameworks
and guides Dan through the process
```

## ðŸ”§ **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **If MCP Tools Don't Appear:**

#### **Check 1: Configuration File**
```bash
# Verify config file syntax:
cat ~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json | python3 -m json.tool

# Expected: Valid JSON output (no syntax errors)
```

#### **Check 2: File Paths**
```bash
# Verify MCP server file exists:
ls -la /home/sakr_quraish/Projects/Danial\ Rag/development/mcp_server/hormozi_mcp.py

# Expected: File exists and is executable

# Test MCP server directly:
cd /home/sakr_quraish/Projects/Danial\ Rag
python3 development/mcp_server/hormozi_mcp.py

# Expected: "Hormozi MCP Server ready for Claude Desktop integration"
```

#### **Check 3: Service Dependencies**
```bash
# Verify FastAPI server running:
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected: healthy status

# Verify PostgreSQL accessible:
PGPASSWORD='rag_secure_password_123' psql -h localhost -U rag_app_user -d hormozi_rag -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM framework_documents;"

# Expected: 20 (number of framework chunks)
```

### **Common Issues and Solutions:**

#### **Issue 1: "Connection failed to localhost:8000"**
**Solution**: Start FastAPI server first:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/Danial\ Rag/production
source config/.env  
python3 -m uvicorn api.hormozi_rag.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### **Issue 2: "MCP server not responding"**
**Solution**: Check Python environment and dependencies:
```bash
# Test MCP server directly:
python3 development/mcp_server/hormozi_mcp.py

# If import errors, check dependencies:
pip3 install aiohttp asyncio
```

#### **Issue 3: "No tools available in Claude"**
**Solution**: Verify MCP configuration:
1. Check claude_desktop_config.json syntax
2. Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
3. Verify file paths are absolute, not relative

## ðŸŽ¯ **CLAUDE DESKTOP USAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Dan's Typical Workflow:**

#### **Scenario 1: Pricing Strategy**
```
Dan: "I'm meeting with a potential client tomorrow. They're a small business 
owner who needs a new website. They mentioned they've been quoted $3k 
elsewhere. I want to charge $8k. What framework should I use to justify 
this pricing?"

Claude (using our tools):
â†’ Calls search_hormozi_frameworks("pricing justification value framework web design")
â†’ Returns specific Hormozi frameworks for pricing justification
â†’ Guides Dan through Value Equation application for web design context
```

#### **Scenario 2: Offer Creation**  
```
Dan: "Create an offer structure for a consulting client who needs help 
with their digital marketing. They're doing about $50k/month now and 
want to get to $100k/month."

Claude (using our tools):
â†’ Calls search_hormozi_frameworks("offer structure consulting digital marketing")
â†’ Returns: Problemsâ†’Solutions framework, Trim & Stack methodology
â†’ Guides Dan through complete offer creation process
```

#### **Scenario 3: Guarantee Development**
```
Dan: "What kind of guarantee should I offer for a high-ticket coaching program?"

Claude (using our tools):  
â†’ Calls search_hormozi_frameworks("guarantee high ticket coaching")
â†’ Returns: Comprehensive Guarantee System with 15+ guarantee types
â†’ Helps Dan choose appropriate guarantee for coaching context
```

## ðŸ“‹ **TEAM SETUP (HANNAH & KATHY)**

### **For Multiple Team Members:**

Each team member needs their own MCP configuration:

#### **Hannah's Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hormozi-frameworks-hannah": {
      "command": "python3", 
      "args": ["/path/to/project/development/mcp_server/hormozi_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "FASTAPI_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "USER_ID": "hannah"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Kathy's Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hormozi-frameworks-kathy": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/project/development/mcp_server/hormozi_mcp.py"], 
      "env": {
        "FASTAPI_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "USER_ID": "kathy"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: All team members share the same FastAPI server and PostgreSQL database, but have individual MCP server instances for tracking.
