# Hormozi "$100M Offers" Framework System - Master Plan

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Build an intelligent system that makes Alex Hormozi's "$100M Offers" frameworks instantly accessible and applicable to the client's sales and offer creation process.

**Client**: Dan (Agency owner selling website services, wants to increase prices and improve offer quality)

**Timeline**: 
- Friday Demo: Core framework querying works
- Week 2: MCP server integration 
- Month 2-3: Learning and optimization

## Understanding the Book Structure

### What "$100M Offers" Actually Is

**NOT:**
- A sales conversation guide
- A collection of scripts  
- Random business advice

**IS:**
- A systematic methodology for making offers people can't refuse
- A mathematical approach to value creation
- A framework for pricing based on value, not cost

### Content Value Hierarchy

**GOLD (20% of book, 80% of value):**
- Value Equation framework
- Offer creation process
- Pricing psychology
- Guarantee structures

**SILVER (30% of book, 15% of value):**
- Examples and case studies
- Bonus strategies
- Scarcity/urgency tactics

**BRONZE (50% of book, 5% of value):**
- Stories and anecdotes
- Mindset content
- General business advice

## Core Frameworks Analysis

### Framework 1: The Value Equation (THE CENTERPIECE)
```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Components:**
- **Dream Outcome**: What the customer really wants
- **Perceived Likelihood**: How certain they are it will work
- **Time Delay**: How long until they get results
- **Effort & Sacrifice**: What they have to give up

**Critical**: This framework must NEVER be split across chunks

### Framework 2: The Offer Creation Stack
1. Identify Dream Outcome
2. List all problems preventing that outcome
3. Turn problems into solutions
4. Create delivery vehicles ("how" you deliver each solution)
5. Trim and stack for highest value

### Framework 3: Pricing Psychology
- Divergent pricing (charge different people different prices)
- Price anchoring techniques
- Premium pricing psychology
- Value-based vs cost-based pricing

### Framework 4: Guarantee Framework
- **Unconditional guarantees**: No questions asked
- **Conditional guarantees**: If you do X, we guarantee Y
- **Anti-guarantees**: Selective selling
- **Implied guarantees**: Built into the offer structure

### Framework 5: Scarcity & Urgency Models
- **Limited supply**: Only X spots available
- **Limited time**: Deadline-driven
- **Limited bonuses**: Extra value with time constraint

### Framework 6: Bonus Strategy
- Each bonus should be worth the entire price
- Name bonuses as separate products
- Stack value to 10x the price
- Logical sequence and relevance

## Strategic Chunking Plan

### Level 1: Framework Preservation Boundaries

**Rule**: Never split a complete framework explanation across chunks

**Framework Boundaries to Preserve:**
- Complete Value Equation explanation (typically 1500-2000 chars)
- Full guarantee type definitions
- Complete offer creation process
- Entire pricing psychology section

### Level 2: Hierarchical Content Mapping

```
Book Root
├── Part 1: Introduction/Theory [BRONZE]
│   └── Context only, lower retrieval priority
├── Part 2: Value Equation [GOLD]
│   ├── Dream Outcome [GOLD]
│   ├── Perceived Likelihood [GOLD] 
│   ├── Time Delay [GOLD]
│   └── Effort & Sacrifice [GOLD]
├── Part 3: Offer Structure [GOLD]
│   ├── Problem → Solution mapping [GOLD]
│   └── Delivery vehicles [SILVER]
├── Part 4: Pricing [GOLD]
├── Part 5: Guarantees [GOLD]
├── Part 6: Scarcity/Urgency [SILVER]
└── Part 7: Bonuses [SILVER]
```

### Level 3: Content Type Classification

**Definitions** (Preserve completely):
- Framework explanations
- Mathematical formulas
- Key terminology

**Processes** (Keep sequential):
- Step-by-step instructions
- Workflow descriptions
- Implementation guides

**Examples** (Can chunk normally):
- Case studies
- Success stories
- Application examples

**Templates** (Preserve completely):
- Exact scripts
- Offer structures
- Specific language patterns

## Retrieval Strategy by Query Type

### Query Type 1: "How do I create an offer?"

**Return Order:**
1. Offer Creation Stack (the process)
2. Value Equation (the theory) 
3. Example of complete offer

**Filtering:**
- content_type: "process", "definition"
- framework_name: "Offer Creation Stack", "Value Equation"
- priority: "gold" first

### Query Type 2: "How do I price this?"

**Return Order:**
1. Value Equation (establish value first)
2. Pricing Psychology 
3. Price anchoring tactics

**Filtering:**
- use_case: "pricing"
- content_type: "definition", "process"
- Sort by importance_score desc

### Query Type 3: "Client says it's too expensive"

**Return Order:**
1. Value Equation (increase perceived value)
2. Guarantee Framework (reduce risk)
3. Bonus stacking (add value without reducing price)

**Filtering:**
- use_case: "objection_handling"
- related_concepts: "risk_reversal", "value_perception"

- Record user interactions
- No analysis yet, just collect

### Week 3-4: First Analysis
- Which frameworks queried most?
- Which chunks retrieved most?
- What queries have poor results?
- Which content gaps exist?

### Month 2: Optimization
- Boost frequently useful chunks
- Re-chunk underperforming content
- Add content for gap areas
- Adjust retrieval thresholds

### Month 3: Intelligence
- System discovers usage patterns
- Automatic quality adjustments
- Predictive framework suggestions
- Context-aware responses

### Feedback Signals

**Implicit Signals:**
- Query frequency by framework
- Chunk retrieval frequency  
- Session length after answer
- Query reformulation patterns

**Explicit Signals:**
- Thumbs up/down ratings
- "This helped close deal" flags
- "This was confusing" reports
- Framework effectiveness ratings

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Chunking Breaks Frameworks
**Mitigation**: 
- Manual framework boundary marking
- Test every framework query
- Validate completeness before deployment

**Test**: Every core framework must be retrievable in full

### Risk 2: Examples Without Context  
**Mitigation**:
- Link every example to parent framework
- Include framework context in chunk headers
- Filter orphaned examples

**Test**: No example chunks without framework reference

### Risk 3: Client Expects Magic on Day 1
**Mitigation**:
- Set clear expectations about evolution
- Demo what works, explain roadmap
- Show improvement trajectory

**Communication**: "This is the foundation. Watch it get smarter."

### Risk 4: Poor Retrieval Quality
**Mitigation**:
- Test with 50+ queries before demo
- Manual quality validation
- A/B test retrieval approaches

**Fallback**: Manual curated responses for critical queries

## Critical Implementation Notes

### What Makes This Senior-Level Work

1. **Respect the Framework Logic**: Don't treat this as generic text
2. **Preserve Conceptual Integrity**: Keep complete concepts together
3. **Build for Evolution**: System gets smarter over time
4. **Focus on Application**: Not just retrieval, but practical use
5. **Integrate with Workflow**: Works within existing tools

### What Would Make This Junior-Level Work

1. Generic RAG with uniform chunking
2. No understanding of framework hierarchy  
3. Static system with no learning
4. Separate interface requiring context switching
5. Technology-first instead of outcome-first

### The Key Insight

**This is not about building RAG for a book.**

**This is about making Hormozi's methodology instantly accessible and applicable to the client's specific business context.**

The book is just data. The value is in:
1. Preserving the framework logic
2. Enabling rapid application  
3. Learning from actual usage
4. Integration with real workflow

Everything else is implementation detail.
