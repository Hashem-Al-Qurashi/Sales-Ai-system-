          "text": "ENHANCING THE OFFER: BONUSES\n\"It's all gravy baby\"\nPLAY ON AN OLD ENGLISH SAYING.\nhave to give special thanks to Jason Fladlien for my renewed appreciation for bonuses. They are so powerful that they earned an entire chapter. In this chapter, I'm going to cover: what to offer, how to pick them, how to value them, how to present them, how to price them.\nThe main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses (see image). The entirety of our offer we came up with at the end of the last section. This section is about how to present those pieces in what order. For example, I may in fact do lots of things in my service, but until I enumerate them, they are unknown. This is why every infomercial of all time continues on with \"but wait\u2026.there's more!\"\nThey would not use these techniques unless they were effective, as every second of air time costs money and must be justified with ROI. You'll also notice that if you watch those old infomercials, they would sell one knife for $38.95 then include 37 other knives, sharpeners, pans, and guarantees to beat the prospect into submission. They establish the price, then they expand upon it until you feel it's such a good deal it would be stupid to pass it up.\nThe reason this works is we are increasing the prospect's price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered instead of cutting the price. We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket.\nWe are now going to present that \"stack\" of deliverables that we assembled earlier in a way that makes them irresistible.\nPro Tip: Add Bonuses Instead of Discounting Whenever Possible on Core Offers\nWhenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.",

Group selling is beyond the scope of this book. But I want to at least address when a bonus would be brought up in a 1-1 selling scenario. When selling one on one, you ask for the sale first, before offering the bonuses. If they say yes, then after they have signed up, you let them know the additional bonuses they're going to get. This creates a wow experience and reinforces their decision to buy.\nOn the other hand, if the person does not buy after the first ask, then you present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, then ask again. Don't feel weird about asking again. You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this consolation was \"Fair enough.\" People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you.\nIf you recall from our \"Trim and Stack\" chapter, each of those deliverables is now being weaponized and presented at the perfect time. We're going to provide all these bonuses to them anyways, but it increases the perception of our offer's value by layering these bonuses one at a time.",

Always offer them (you can use the bulleted bundle we came up with at the end of Section III)\n2. Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title\n3. Tell them:\na) How it relates to their issue\nb) What it is\nc) How you discovered it, or what you had to do to create it\nd) How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience\ni) Faster, easier or less effort/sacrifice (value equation)\n4. Provide some proof (this can be a stat, a past client, or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable\n5. Paint a vivid mental image of what their life will be like assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits\n6. Always ascribe a price tag to them and justify it\n7. Tools & checklists are better than additional trainings (as the effort & time are lower with the former, so the value is higher. The value equation still reigns supreme).\n8. They should each address a specific concern/obstacle in the prospects mind about why they can't or won't be successful (bonus should prove their belief incorrect)\n9. This can also be what they would logically realize they will need next. You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it.\n10. The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also, subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses right? (No, but you can use this psychological bias to make your offer seem wildly compelling).\n11. You can further enhance the value of your bonuses by adding scarcity and urgency to the bonus themselves (which takes this technique and puts it on steroids).\na) Bonuses With Scarcity\nVersion 1: Only people who sign up for XZY program will have access to my Bonus #1, 2, 3 that are never for sale or available anywhere else other than through this program.\nVersion 2: I have 3 tickets left to my $5,000 virtual event, if you buy this program you can get one of the last 3 tickets as a bonus.\nb) Bonuses With Urgency\nVersion 1: If you buy today, I will add in XYZ bonus that normally costs $1,000, for free. And I'll do that because I want to reward action takers.\nc) With hope, you can see the subtle differences. The first two examples aren't constrained by time. They state that if you buy the program you will get things you normally would not be able to. The bonus with urgency is about them buying today, and if they do not buy today, they lose those bonuses.

This is free marketing for them, and high value products for you at no cost. Businesses will do this because you are going to give their business exposure for free to the highest quality prospects, your customers. As long as they are not direct competitors, you can get some brownie points, secure some future referral IOUs, and make your offer more valuable at the same time. If you secure enough of these relationships, you can literally justify your entire price in the savings and additional true-to-price bonuses.\nFor example - if I owned a pain clinic, I might get a massage therapist to give me 1-2 free massages to incorporate into my offer. On top of that, I might get:\n...a chiropractor to give me two free adjustments. (Value: $100)\n...a low inflammation food company to give me discounts for their products ($50 savings)\n...discounts for braces and orthotics ($150 savings)\n...a local health club down the street to give me a personal training session for free and a free month of membership to their pool ($100 Value)\n...discounts on pharmaceutical drugs from the local pharmacist ($100/mo in savings)\n...repeat the above for multiple service providers (so perhaps I get ten chiropractors to all give me a free adjustment, now I have ten free adjustments in my bundle.\n...Etc\nNow if my offer was $400, then the value of these free bonuses ALONE is worth more than the $400.\nAs if that weren't already awesome enough, if you really want to be a jedi, negotiate a group discount and a commission to yourself. This is exactly what we did with our supplement company. Our gym owner clients who use our sister supplement company Prestige Labs sponsored athletes get a 30% discount on our products, on top of that, the sponsored athlete gets paid 40% of all sales netted after the applied discount.\nSo it's a win-win for everyone. Their clients get it for 30% less than our main site. They get paid for giving away exclusive discounts. And we get customers in exchange for the commission paid. Everyone wins.\nIf you are following along, each of these bonuses can become revenue streams for you indirectly by getting clients to say YES more easily, and directly because you can negotiate that each of these businesses can pay you for the people you send their way.\nSo let's also say we negotiated the following \"affiliate commissions\" for making the introduction to these businesses.\n...the chiro gives you $100 per person who comes into their office\n...the food company gives you free food (yum!)\n...orthotics company gives you $100 per person referred\n...health club gives you a free membership OR $50 per person who signs up\n...pharmacy gives you $100 per person\nNow let's look at how much money we made...our $400 offer now has the possibility of making us an extra $350...pure profit! That's the beauty of these relationships. The other businesses will pay you and you don't have to do anything but refer customers to them that you have already spent the money to acquire.\nAnd if you really want to get crazy, come up with a grand slam offer with these partner businesses by using the same concepts in the book so that each of the bonuses themselves becomes even more valuable than a simple commoditized service.",

You can get people to act faster. You can price anchor and product anchor (little known). You can get more people to say yes than you otherwise would. If you want to a live deep dive with me on this, go to Acquisition.com/training/offers and select \"Bonus Creation\" to watch a short video tutorial. I also have a Free Bonus Checklist I use when creating offers. Swipe it for your own business on the house!\nSummary\nWe want to employ bonuses because they expand the price to value discrepancy and get people to purchase who otherwise wouldn't. They massively increase the prospects' perception of the value of our offer. So here's what to do:\n1. Create checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, and anything else that would take lots of time and effort to create on one's own, but is easy to use once created. Anything that you can invest in one time that clearly cost time or money to create, but can be given away endless time is a perfect fit for a bonus.\n2. Beyond that, make a habit to record every workshop, every webinar, every event, every interview and use them as additional bonuses (as needed to crush a perceived obstacle).\n3. Proactively negotiate group discounts and a referral commission with adjacent businesses that solve needs your customer will have as a result of beginning this process with you. What's the next natural thing they might want? Go to those businesses, get a deal for them they could never get for themselves (because you are negotiating with the purchasing power of all your customers at once, very powerful).\nAuthor Note: The longer you are in business the more of these bonus assets you will have at your disposal. All of these things are valuable. Put them in a vault and keep them in your back pocket to sprinkle into an offer to get the deal closed. Information products work very well here because they have high perceived value, low cost, and zero operational effort besides giving an additional login. Tickets to virtual experiences or events work too. Same goes for a higher level of service that has a fixed cost like giving someone VIP service for a month (which also doubles as a way of upselling them into that level of service to keep them on it . . . more on that in Book II.)\nWhat should be a bonus vs part of the core offer if I am the one fulfilling it?\nShort answer: Wow Factor - in other words - something you wouldn't want someone to miss. Many times you have so much \"stuff\" you will be providing your customers (good thing) that valuable nuggets can get lost in the mix. You want to take the most distinct ones that can almost stand on their own and pull those out to highlight them. This is especially true for things that are short in length but high in quality or value. Checklists or infographics can condense a lot of information into a small space. Someone might not feel justified paying lots of money for a product launch map (for example) but as a bonus would be perceived as very valuable.\nNext Up . . .\nWe have our core offer. We are presenting it in a way to increase scarcity and urgency to increase the likelihood they want it even more. We stacked the bonuses of our offer to make the price to value discrepancy out of this world and break our prospects' minds. Next on our magical journey will be addressing the big elephant in the room...risk. We will completely obliterate it using a combination of guarantees so they have no reason not to buy.",

          "text": "ENHANCING THE OFFER: GUARANTEES\n\"You're gonna like the way you look...I guarantee it.\"\nMEN'S WAREHOUSE AD THAT RAN FOREVER.\nThe single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is...drum roll...risk. Risk that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do for them. Therefore, reversing risk is an immediate way to make any offer more attractive. You will want to spend a disproportionate amount of time figuring out how you want to reverse it. That being said, how much more attractive can a guarantee make an offer?\nJason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, once stated that he had seen the conversion on an offer 2-4x simply by changing the quality of the guarantee. It's that important.\nFrom an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees: 1. Unconditional 2. Conditional 3. Anti-Guarantee 4. Implied Guarantees.\nYou must always hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why.\nBut won't people take advantage of a crazy guarantee?\nSometimes, but not usually. That being said, you must understand the math. If you close 130 percent as many people, and your refund percentage doubles from 5 percent to 10 percent, you've still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that all goes to the bottom line.\nEx: 100 sales, 5 refunds (5%) = 95 Net Sales\nGuarantee Offer 130 sales, 13 refunds (10%)= 117 Net sales\n117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)\nDon't be emotional, just do the math. For a guarantee to not be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be 100 percent offset by people who refunded. So an absolute increase in sales of 5 percent would need to be offset by an absolute increase in refunds of 5 percent (but that might be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely). So, for the most part, the stronger the guarantee, the higher the net increase in total purchases, even if the refund rate increases alongside it.\nWarning: While guarantees can be effective sellers, people who buy because of guarantees can become very shitty customers. A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to see success with your product or service. In a world where you want to reverse risk and get customers the best outcome possible, tying your guarantee to the things they need to do to be successful can help all parties.\nPro Tip: High Cost Services Warning\nIf you have a tremendous amount of cost associated with your product or service, you will likely want to employ a conditional guarantee or an ANTI guarantee, as you will have to eat the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling.",

          "text": "From an overarching perspective there are four types of guarantees: 1. Unconditional 2. Conditional 3. Anti-Guarantee 4. Implied Guarantees.\nTypes of Guarantees\nWhat makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z.\nTo give a guarantee teeth you have to decide what you'll do if they don't get the result.\nWithout the \"or what\" portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted.\nNote: This is what most marketers do.\nBad Example: We will get you 20 clients guaranteed.\nBetter example: You will get 20 clients in your first 30 days, or we give you your money back + your advertising dollars spent with us. This is a simple, but strong guarantee.\nHere are the four types of guarantees. I'll go over them in theory then we will apply them.\n1) Unconditional Guarantees\nAs I stated earlier, there are unconditional, conditional, and \"anti-\" guarantees. Unconditional are the strongest guarantees. They're basically a trial where they pay first then see if they like it. This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you will have some people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.\n2) Conditional Guarantees\nConditional guarantees include \"terms and conditions\" to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on. In general, you want these to be \"better than money back\" guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you want to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment. These also can have a very powerful effect on getting clients results. If you know the key actions someone must take in order to be successful, make those part of the conditional guarantee. In a perfect world, 100% of your customers would qualify for a conditional guarantee, but will have achieved their result, and therefore will not want to take it. That is an ideal we can all aspire towards. And just fyi - if given the option of getting a refund or getting the outcome they were promised the vast majority of people will take the outcome.\n3) Anti-Guarantees\nAnti-guarantees are when you explicitly state \"all sales are final.\" You will want to own this position. You must come up with a creative \"reason why\" the sales are final. Typically, you'll want to show a massive exposure or vulnerability on your part that a consumer could immediately understand and think \"Yes, that makes sense.\" These types of guarantees are especially important with items that are consumable or massively diminish in value once given.\n4) Implied Guarantees\nImplied guarantees are any offer that is a performance-based offer. This comes in many different forms. Revshare, profitshare, triggers, ratchets, monetary bonuses, etc are all examples. The end all concept is the same, if I don't perform, I don't get paid. Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of \"If I do a great job, I will be very well compensated.\" These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that you will get compensated when you do perform.\nStacking Guarantees\nAn experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees. For example, you could give an unconditional 30 day no questions asked guarantee then on top of that give a conditional triple your money back 90 day guarantee. That would be an example of stacking an unconditional with a conditional guarantee.\nYou can also stack two conditional guarantees around different (or sequential) outcomes. For example, you'll make $10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do thing 1, 2, and 3. This future paces the prospect into an outcome they now believe is far more likely (since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for achievement). Doing this shows the prospect you are serious about getting them results and convinced that they will achieve what they want. This shifts the burden of risk back from them onto us...a very powerful strategy.",

It's also very risky. You put yourself in a situation where if someone does not achieve the results, whether because of your fault or not, you will still be held accountable. Obviously this is a strong, but unoriginal guarantee. You can add conditions, but the more conditions you add, the faster this guarantee loses its teeth.\nWording: I heard Jason Fladlien, who I referenced earlier, pitch his unconditional guarantee on a webinar and I thought it was unbelievable. These are 100% his words and not my own. I take no credit for this but have included it for completeness.\n\"I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision, that is all. The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. So you get on the inside and see if everything we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you. Then, if it is, that's when you decide to keep it. If it's not for you, no hard feelings. You will then, after signing up at URL be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn't for you. But you can't make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it. And know this...whether it's 29 min or 29 days from now...if you ain't happy, I ain't happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you want your money back you can get it because I only want to keep your money if you're happy. All you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell use \"gimme my money\" and you got it, and in short order - our response times to any support request average 61min over a 24/7 time period. You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you have is the real deal and I'm fairly confident that when you sign up at URL you're getting exactly what you need to BENEFIT.\"\nPro Tip: Name Your Guarantee Something Cool\nIf you are going to give a guarantee, spice it up. Instead of using \"satisfaction\" or some other \"vanilla\" word, describe it more strongly.\nGeneric Example (Bad): 30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee.\nCreative Imagery Example #1 (Good): In 30 days, if you wouldn't jump into shark infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar you paid.\nCreative Imagery Example #2 (Great): You'll get our famous \"Club a Baby Seal Guarantee\"After 30 days of using our services, if you wouldn't club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don't have to pay a penny.\n[Unconditional] Satisfaction-Based Refund Guarantee (Expanded from above):\nWhat the Client Gets: If at any time they're not satisfied with the level of service they're receiving from you, they can request a refund (at any time) for the program.\nMy Take: Believe it or not, this was my guarantee when I sold weight-loss programs. Besides being an irresistible offer, I guaranteed satisfaction. I used the strength of my guarantee to close a lot of deals. \"Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm not guaranteeing you're going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I'll write you a check the day you tell me we suck.\"\nIt works perfectly with a best-case/worst-case close. \"Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today.\" If you are good at what you do, you can use a guarantee like this to push a lot of people over the edge. That line made me a lot of money. I had two people take me up on it out of 4,000 sales in three and a half years.\nSatisfaction/No questions asked is the highest form of guarantee. It means we could do everything right and you could still ask for your money back. As long as you know the math, you will typically make up for the refunds in spaces with higher and faster closing on the sales side. But you have to be good at fulfilling your promises. If not, steer clear. I believe this offer works much better in lower-ticket situations. It becomes very risky as you go into higher-ticket services with higher costs of fulfillment.\nPro Tip: Unconditional vs Conditional Based on Business Type\nBigger broader guarantees work better with lower ticket B2C businesses (many people just won't bother taking the time). The higher the ticket, and the more business oriented it is, the more you want to steer towards specific guarantees. That may or may not include refunds, and may or may not have conditions.",

And this is a guarantee to add with a consumption condition. That means they must do a variety of things to qualify for this guarantee. A world class affiliate marketer Jason Fladlien (who did $27M in a single day) recently used an amazing guarantee for a course he sold. He said \"if you buy this course and spend $X on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000 no questions asked.\" He claimed that an additional $3M in sales came from this crazy guarantee on a $2997 course. What's more, he only gave 10 of these $25,000 refunds out. So the refund generated $2.75M in extra sales. That's what a crazy guarantee does for you.\nIn general, a very strong guarantee like this will definitely drive more sales. This really serves the purpose when you need a lot of stuff to be done by your prospect, and, assuming those things are done, there's a low chance of the result not being achieved. Sometimes a guarantee like this can actually get clients better results on top. This guarantee will typically outperform a traditional 30-day money back guarantee in terms of net conversions (sales minus refunds).\n[Conditional] Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You keep working for them free of charge until X is achieved.\nMy Take: This is probably my personal favorite guarantee of all time. It essentially guarantees they will achieve their goal, but it eliminates the element of time. You are never at risk for losing the money. The guarantee is around the outcome. To add further flavor to it, you can make this guarantee conditional on them doing key actions linked with success: setting up a web page, attending calls, showing up to workouts, weighing in, reporting data, etc.\nReal Talk: Since I have been advising businesses to use this particular guarantee, I have yet to have a single person say a client took them up on it. Realistically, if someone actually does everything you asked them to do and doesn't achieve the result by the time you had said, one of two things usually happens:\n1. Seeing your client's commitment, you happily keep working with them until they achieve the desired result\n2. It gets dropped. Your client is likely very close to the goal, which means satisfied.\nAlso, it's likely the sales conversation with the guarantee was months earlier. What may have been important in the sales conversation is a distant memory now, replaced by their affection towards you/your business.\n[Conditional] Modified Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You give them another Y-long period of service or access to your product/services free of charge. Generally, Y should give them at least twice the duration.\nMy Take: This is like the service guarantee, but it ties a specific duration to your extended work/involvement. So instead of being on the hook \"forever,\" you're only on the hook for an additional Y period of time. I've seen it work magically and keep the business on the hook for a more finite period of time which may be an easier place for you to start before doing the \"all out\" Service Guarantee above.\n[Conditional] Credit-based Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You give them back what they paid but in a credit toward any service you offer.\nMy Take: This is best used during an upsell process to seal the deal on a service they are unsure they will like. They already like what they have, you are trying to sell them more of that. Worst case, they can apply it to the thing they already like. So it maintains goodwill with the customer.\n[Conditional] Personal Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You work with them one-on-one, free of charge, until they reach X objective or result.\nMy Take: This is absolutely one of the strongest guarantees in existence. It's like a service guarantee on crack. You will definitely want to add conditions, though: they must respond back in twenty-four hours, they must use the products you tell them to, they must XYZ. Only if they do that, will you keep working with them one-on-one.\nThis is especially powerful as you scale and become more edified as a business owner. Can you imagine one of my sales people saying, \"Alex will personally work with you until your offer converts\"? Right. It would work. It would also be a nightmare. So I would probably put contingencies like, \"Provided you've already spent $10,000 on your existing offer using our structure, the offer you ran was for lead generation, and it was a free offer. These are things that would make it unlikely they would not succeed. If for some reason they hadn't with those stipulations in place, I could probably fix their problem in ten minutes just looking at it.",

I just love it a lot for workshops and in-person experiences. Normally the event would cost more than the hotel and airfare, so it's like adding an extra $1000 to a guarantee but way more tangible. It's original enough that people like it.\n[Conditional] Wage-Payment Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You offer to pay their hourly rate, whatever that may be, if they don't find your call/session with them valuable.\nMy Take: This is also an ancillary cost guarantee, just a very original one. If someone ever actually asks for the wage payment, just ask them for their tax return and divide it by 1,960 (number of working hours at 40hrs/wk for a year). But no one asking for a refund will actually do that, so you will never actually have to give one of these out. Like ever.\n[Conditional] Release of Service Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You let them out of their contract free of charge.\nMy Take: This voids a commitment or cancellation fee. If you have a business that has enforceable commitments, contracts or clauses, this can be a powerful guarantee. Better yet, if you are in a business that does not enforce your contracts, then you have nothing to lose by adding the guarantee.\n[Conditional] Delayed Second Payment Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You won't bill them again until after they make or get their first outcome. Ex: Lose your first five pounds . . . make your first sale . . . get your website live, etc.\nMy Take: I like this a lot, especially if you have a very systematized process for getting the first result. It gets the prospect thinking in fast action terms and gets them moving. It will also focus your team on activating your client. This is a great one when you know what metric or action drives activation (predicting indicator of long term retention) of a client.\nI've successfully used this guarantee loads of times.\n[Conditional] First Outcome Guarantee\nWhat the Client Gets: You continue to pay their ancillary costs (ad spend, hotel, etc) until they reach their first outcome. Example: If you don't make your first sale in 14 days, we will pay for your ad spend until you do.\nMy Take: Just like the delayed second payment, just centered around a different cost. I personally like this setup a lot. It keeps everyone focused on getting that first dollar over the bridge. Once that one comes across, the second comes soon after.",

Likely, this is a very powerful thing that once seen cannot be unseen, or once used cannot be taken away. Example: a line of code to improve your checkout experience on a website. Once someone received this code, they could try and use it without paying you. Or a series of opening messages for picking up girls, or opening sentences for messaging cold prospects. Things that are very valuable but incredibly easy to steal after they've been seen/understood.\nMy Take: This can enhance the persuasiveness of the sale and the value of the product or service. It essentially implies that the client is going to use it and see an immense benefit thereby exposing the business to vulnerability. It acts as a damaging admission. We have an \"all sales are final\" policy, but that is because our product is so exclusive and so powerful that once used it cannot be unused.\" Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is attention-worthy.\nSo instead of being wishy-washy, lean into the fact this thing works so well, and is so easy to copy, you must make all sales final. They'll believe you even more if you take this position. \"We are going to show you our proprietary process that we are using right now to generate leads in our business. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We're going to be exposing the inner workings of our business, as a result, all sales are final.\" Note: strong reason why is needed here. Just make one up that sounds compelling. The more you can show real exposure, the more effective this will be.\nAnti-guarantees can also work very well with high ticket products and services that require a lot of work or customization. \"If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you are not the type of person we want to work with. We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and are not looking for a way out before they even begin. If you are not serious, don't buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing. \" From these examples, you should get the idea.\nImplied Guarantees: Performance Models, Revshares, and Profit-Sharing\nPerformance: A) ...Only pay me $XXX per sale/ $XXX per show B) $XX per Lb Lost\nRevshare: A) 10% of top line revenue B) 20% profit share C) 25% of revenue growth from baseline\nProfit-Share: A) X% of profit B) X% of Gross Profit\nRatchets: 10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% if over Z\nBonuses/Triggers: I get X when Y occurs.\nWhat The Client Gets: If you do not perform, they do not have to pay. If you perform, your compensation has been determined based on an agreement decided upon before you begin working.\nMy Take: Performance, Revshare, and Profit-shares aren't guarantees \"per se\", but for all intents and purposes, they are. There is an implied guarantee whenever you enter into a revshare or performance partnership: if you dont make money, you don't have to pay me. In my opinion, this is one of, if not THE most desirable setup. First because it makes you accountable to your clients' results. Second it weeds out low performers. Perfect alignment between client and service provider fosters collaboration and a long-term relationship. I'm a big fan. The drawbacks are tracking and collection. So if you can find a way around that...you've hit a gold mine. This is a part of the offer we teach our agencies who use our software. We help them switch from a retainer model to a performance model and wrap that into the Grand Slam Offer I walked through earlier. I've seen countless agencies go from $20k/mo to $200k+/mo in a matter of a few months.\nYou can also pair a revshare or performance setup with a minimum. It would be like saying \"we get the greater of $1000 or 10% of revenue generated.\" So if the client doesn't generate money because of whatever reason this at least covers your costs of services etc.\nOr saying we get $1000/mo for the first 3 months, then after that, it switches to 100% performance. This would be ideal for a setup that takes a lot of time to get going.\nThese types of offers work well when you have quantifiable outcomes. The stronger, of course, is no guaranteed payment without performance.",

The stronger, of course, is no guaranteed payment without performance.\nCreate Your Own Winning Guarantee\nReversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer. Experienced marketers spend as much time crafting their guarantees as the deliverables themselves. It's that important.\nI have personally used all the guarantees listed above (except for the hotel and phone call one, which I just saw and liked). But you can come up with your own! The key is to identify a client's biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. \"What do they not want to have happen if they pay you? What are they most afraid of?\" Reverse their fears into a guarantee. Think of the time, emotion, and outside costs associated with any program or service. The more specific and creative the guarantee is, the better.\nThat being said, guarantees are enhancers. They can enhance the magnetism or attraction of any offer, but they cannot make a business. If a guarantee is used to cover up a poor sales team or a poor product, it will backfire into lots of refunds. No bueno.\nMy advice: Start selling service-based guarantees or setting up performance partnerships. This will make all sales final (so no fear from refunds). Most importantly, it will commit you to your customers' results and keep you honest. From there, either keep that guarantee and scale (perfectly fine), or move up the food chain to less restrictive guarantees to increase volume.\nWe now have a core offer built and guarantees chosen.\nNext Up...\nNow all we have to do is put a bow on this puppy and actually name it. Naming an offer correctly determines how well your advertising converts, how big of a response you get from outbound emails/cold calls/texts, and how many inbound responses you get from organic comments.\nIt matters.\nThat being said, I will show you how to generate unlimited names or \"wrapping paper\" for your offer. That way it never fatigues, no matter how small your market may be.

I clenched my jaw to fend off the knot in my throat that I knew would lead to tears. I wanted to give in. Years of emotions were bottled below the surface.\nYears of ignoring my reality and lack of success. Years of putting off how I felt just focusing on moving forward. The pressure was shooting to the surface. I could feel it.\n\"We did it,\" I said.\nLeila, my wife now, looked up at me. She was in the kitchen making dinner and stopped, spatula in hand. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"We did it.

That's amazing!!\"\nShe ran over to me, disregarding the food on the stove, and wrapped her arms around my neck, spatula still in hand.\n\"I'm so proud of you\"\nShe squeezed me. I slumped into her arms. It was like every knot in my body that I had been holding onto melted all at once. I could barely contain myself. But when I think back to it, the feeling I had wasn't happiness. It was relief. I'd moved from fear to security. I'd traded feeling like a failure everyday, watching my work and effort yield nothing, to realizing a dream. The constant anxiety and fear of \"what are we gonna do\" finally be replaced by something else. I finally had time to let myself feel something.\nI felt like this \"struggle\" chapter of life was finally over.\n\"Look,\" I said. \"It's for real\"\nI nuzzled my head out of Leila's arms.

It wasn't \"profit\" that was still in the business account, only to be taken out later by some unforeseen emergency. It wasn't \"earmarked\" money that had to be used to pay off some debt. It was ours.

To advance, I find that we must determine which skills, beliefs, and character traits we lack. Most times, we simply need to improve. And the only way to do that is through learning from experience and/or high quality sources. I have received terrible advice from people who were ahead of me at the time. And though experience is the best teacher, she is not the kindest.\nIt is my most sincere hope that what I produce provides the guidance I so desperately needed when I was coming up on my entrepreneurial journey. And I wish I could cover it all in a single book (for my sake and yours). But, to do you the service I wish I had had, I cannot. The devil is in the details. Excellence exists in the depth of knowledge and nuances. That's what separates the greats from everyone else. I hope that in all the content I produce you see my dedication to this detail and nuance that makes all the difference. These lessons were hard won.\nI hope you've enjoyed this first volume in my offers series. Before we move forward into volume two, where we'll be focusing on lead generation, as mentioned above, I wanted to circle back to where we started. After reading this book, I hope:\n1. You're well on the path to creating your first Grand Slam Offer. Or at the very least, can take components that you were missing in your offer to make it more compelling to your market.\n2. I've delivered on my promise from the beginning of this book: that investing two to three hours of your time here would yield you a far higher return than just about anything else you could do.\n3. I hope in return I've taken one small step towards earning the thing I value most from you -- your trust.\nFinally, I hope this book creates a small dent in improving the world because I believe no one is coming to save us. It's up to us, as entrepreneurs, to innovate our way into a better world. And that's something I'm willing to devote my life to. And I hope you are, too.\nI'm grateful for your attention. You could have given it to anything, and you chose to invest it with me. I take it in high regard. So, sincerely, thank you.\nStay hungry,\nAlex",
