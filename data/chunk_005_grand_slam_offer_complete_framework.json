  "text": "But What Does A Grand Slam Offer Do?\n\nAlright, let's start by defining a Grand Slam Offer.\n\nIt's an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash constraint on business growth.\n\nIn other words, it allows you to sell in a \"category of one,\" or, to apply another great phrase, to \"sell in a vacuum.\" The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product and nothing. So you can sell at whatever price you get the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else. As a result, it gets you more customers, at higher ticket prices, for less money. If you like fancy marketing terms, it breaks down like this:\n\n1. Increased Response Rates (think clicks)\n2. Increased Conversion (think sales)\n3. Premium Prices (think charging a lot of money).\n\nHaving a Grand Slam Offer increases your response rates to advertisements (aka more people will click or take an action on an advertisement they see containing a Grand Slam Offer).\n\nIf you pay the same amount for eyeballs but 1) more people respond, 2) more of those responses buy, and 3) they buy for higher prices, your business grows.\n\nI've \"struck gold\" on my share of offers. Not because I've got some superpower, but because I've just done this a lot of times (and failed even more). I sorted through the crap that chronically fails and pocketed all the stuff that reproducibly succeeds (and put it in this book).\n\nHere's the key takeaway from all this: a business does the same work in both cases (with a commoditized or a Grand Slam Offer). The fulfillment is the same. But if one business uses a Grand Slam Offer and another uses a \"commodity\" offer, the Grand Slam Offer makes that business appear as if it has a totally different product — and that means a value-driven, versus price-driven, purchase.\n\nIf you have a \"commodity\" offer, you will compete on price (having a price-driven purchase versus a value-driven purchase). Your Grand Slam Offer, however, forces a prospect to stop and think differently to assess the value of your differentiated product. Doing this establishes you as your own category, which means it's too difficult to compare prices, which means you re-calibrate the prospect's value-meter.\n\nReal Life Grand Slam Offer Money Math: Before and After\n\nQuick backstory . . . one of our companies is a software that advertising agencies use to work leads for their customers. Using this software, agencies transform their offer from a commoditized offer of lead generation services to a Grand Slam Offer of \"pay for performance.\" Let me show you the multiplicative effect it has on the revenue of the business.\n\n**While rounded for illustration's sake, these values are based on the real numbers a lead generation agency selling services to brick and mortar businesses experience**\n\nOld Commoditized Way (Price-Driven) — Race to the bottom\n\nCommoditized Offer: $1,000 down, then $1,000/mo retainer for agency services\n\nBreakdown: At .5 to 1 return on advertising spend, you lose money getting customers. But in 30 days, those 5 customers will pay another $1,000 each, bringing you to $10,000 in total and break even. The next month, the $5,000 that comes in would be your first profitable month, and each month thereafter would be profitable (assuming they all stay).\n\nThis is an example of a commoditized service — normal agency work. There's a million of them, and they all look the same. Commoditized businesses and offers have a harder time getting responses from ads because all their marketing looks the same as everyone else's.\n\nNote: It all looks the same because they are all making the same offer.\nYou pay us to work.\nWe do work.\nMaybe you get results from that work. Maybe you don't.\n\nIt's reasonable, but it's easily duplicated (and subject to commoditization). This commoditization creates a price-driven purchase . . .\n\nYou are forced to be priced \"competitively\" to get clients and to stay that way to keep them. If the client sees a cheaper version of the \"same thing,\" then the value discrepancy will cause them to swap providers. This is a dilemma . . . lose this client, the rest of your clients, and potential clients, or stay \"competitive.\" Your margins become so thin they vanish.\n\nFurthermore, it's hard to get prospects to say yes (and keep them saying yes) unless you're hypervigilant about clients commoditizing your business by staying \"competitive.\" And that's the problem with the old commoditized way. They're able to compare. Unless you switch to a Grand Slam Offer, your prices will keep getting beaten down. The business eventually dies, or the entrepreneur throws in the towel. No bueno.\n\nWe want to make an offer that's so different that you can skip the awkward explanation of why your product is different from everyone elses (which, if they have to ask, then they are probably too ignorant to understand the explanation) and instead just have the offer do that work for you. That's the Grand Slam Offer way.\n\nLet's dive in to see the contrast in sales numbers.\n\nNew Grand Slam Offer Way (Differentiated, Incomparable) (Value-Driven)\n\nGrand Slam Offer: Pay one time. (No recurring fee. No retainer.) Just cover ad spend. I'll generate leads and work your leads for you. And only pay me if people show up. And I'll guarantee you get 20 people in your first month, or you get your next month free. I'll also provide all the best practices from the other businesses like yours.\n\nDaily sales coaching for your staff\nTested scripts\nTested price points and offers to swipe and deploy\nSales recordings\n. . . and everything else you need to sell and fulfill your customers. I'll give you the entire play book for (insert industry), absolutely free just for becoming a client.\n\nIn a nutshell, I'm feeding people into your business, showing you, exactly, how to sell them so that you can get the highest prices, which means that you make the most money possible . . . sound fair enough?\n\nIt's clear these are drastically different offers . . . but so what? Where's the money!? Let's compare both in the below chart.\n\nBreakdown: You spend the same amount of money for the same eyeballs. Then, you get 2.5x more people to respond to your advertisement because it's a more compelling offer. From there, you close 2.5x as many people because the offer is so much more compelling. From there, you are able to charge a 4x higher price up front. The end result is 2.5 x 2.5 x 4 = 22.4x more cash collected up front. Yes, you spent $10,000 to make $112,000. You just made money getting new customers.\n\nComparison: Remember the old way, the way you lost half the ad spend up front? With the new way, you are making more money and getting more customers. This means that your cost to acquire a customer is so cheap (relative to how much you make) that your limiting factor becomes your ability to do the work you already love doing. Cash flow and acquiring customers is no longer your bottleneck because it's 22.4x more profitable than the old model. Yup. You read that right. This is the part in the action movie where you walk away from an explosion in slow motion.\n\nThis is the exact Grand Slam Offer we used with our software business that serves agencies. The numbers can become wild . . . fast. I know 22.4x better sounds unreasonable, but that's the point. If you play the same game everyone else does, you'll get the same results everyone else does (mediocre). You hit singles and doubles, keep the lights on, but never get ahead. But remember the opening passage of this book: that when you align all the pieces, you can knock it out of the park so well that you win for good. In my first 18 months in business, we went from $500k/year to $28,000,000/yr off of less than $1M in ad spend. So, when I say 20:1 . . . 50:1 . . . 100:1 returns, I mean it. When you get this right, the results are, well . . . unbelievable.",
